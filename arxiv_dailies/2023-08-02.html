In real-world applications such as hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL (Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing methods.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00155"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.00214", "Date": "Tue, 01 Aug 2023 01:12:29 ", "Title": "Robust Single-view Cone-beam X-ray Pose Estimation with Neural Tuned Tomography (NeTT) and Masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF)", "Authors": ["Chaochao Zhou", "Syed Hasib Akhter Faruqui", "Abhinav Patel", "Ramez N.

Recent advances in the differentiable rendering of optically reflective materials have enabled state-of-the-art performance in RGB camera view synthesis and pose estimation. Expanding on these prior works, we introduce new methods for pose estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray projections, and we demonstrate the critical role of optimal view synthesis in performing this task. We first develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within TensorFlow. In conjunction with classic CBCT reconstruction algorithms, we perform pose estimation by gradient descent using a loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose. We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely on classic CBCT; NeTT directly optimizes the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success rates more than 93%. Furthermore, we show that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize high-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects. Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust pose estimation using fluoroscopic projections.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00214"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.00287", "Date": "Tue, 01 Aug 2023 05:01:05 ", "Title": "A Study of Unsupervised Evaluation Metrics for Practical and Automatic Domain Adaptation", "Authors": ["Minghao Chen", "Zepeng Gao", "Shuai Zhao", "Qibo Qiu", "Wenxiao Wang", "Binbin Lin", "Xiaofei He"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.LG"}, "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate the transfer of models to target domains without labels.

In this paper, we aim to find an evaluation metric capable of assessing the quality of a transferred model without access to target validation labels. We begin with the metric based on mutual information of the model prediction. Through empirical analysis, we identify three prevalent issues with this metric: 1) It does not account for the source structure. 2) It can be easily attacked. 3) It fails to detect negative transfer caused by the over-alignment of source and target features. To address the first two issues, we incorporate source accuracy into the metric and employ a new MLP classifier that is held out during training, significantly improving the result. To tackle the final issue, we integrate this enhanced metric with data augmentation, resulting in a novel unsupervised UDA metric called the Augmentation Consistency Metric (ACM). Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of previous experiment settings and conduct large-scale experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed metric.

In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate OOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features to identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID) data.

To leverage the heterogeneous compute capability of modern datacenters, we develop an approach for compiler-level partitioning of deep neural networks (DNNs) onto multiple interconnected hardware devices. We present a general framework for heterogeneous DNN compilation, offering automatic partitioning and device mapping. Our scheduler integrates both an exact solver, through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and a modularity-based heuristic for scalability. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical lower bound formula for the optimal solution, which enables the assessment of the heuristic solutions' quality. We evaluate our scheduler in optimizing both conventional DNNs and randomly-wired neural networks, subject to latency and throughput constraints, on a heterogeneous system comprised of a CPU and two distinct GPUs. Compared to na\\\"ively running DNNs on the fastest GPU, he proposed framework can achieve more than 3$\\times$ times lower latency and up to 2.9$\\times$ higher throughput by automatically leveraging both data and model parallelism to deploy DNNs on our sample heterogeneous server node.

However, functions on such complex objects (e.g., point sets and graphs) are often required to be invariant to a wide variety of group actions e.g. permutation or rigid transformation. Therefore, continuous and symmetric product functions (such as distance functions) on such complex objects must also be invariant to the product of such group actions. We call these functions symmetric and factor-wise group invariant (or SFGI functions in short). In this paper, we first present a general neural network architecture for approximating SFGI functions. The main contribution of this paper combines this general neural network with a sketching idea to develop a specific and efficient neural network which can approximate the $p$-th Wasserstein distance between point sets. Very importantly, the required model complexity is independent of the sizes of input point sets. On the theoretical front, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that there exists a neural network with the capacity to approximate Wasserstein distance with bounded model complexity. Our work provides an interesting integration of sketching ideas for geometric problems with universal approximation of symmetric functions.

One common approach in PU learning is to sample a set of pseudo-negatives from the unlabeled data using ad-hoc thresholds so that conventional supervised methods can be applied with both positive and negative samples. Owing to the label uncertainty among the unlabeled data, errors of misclassifying unlabeled positive samples as negative samples inevitably appear and may even accumulate during the training processes. Those errors often lead to performance degradation and model instability. To mitigate the impact of label uncertainty and improve the robustness of learning with positive and unlabeled data, we propose a new robust PU learning method with a training strategy motivated by the nature of human learning: easy cases should be learned first. Similar intuition has been utilized in curriculum learning to only use easier cases in the early stage of training before introducing more complex cases. Specifically, we utilize a novel ``hardness'' measure to distinguish unlabeled samples with a high chance of being negative from unlabeled samples with large label noise. An iterative training strategy is then implemented to fine-tune the selection of negative samples during the training process in an iterative manner to include more ``easy'' samples in the early stage of training.

To address this limitation, we utilized an alternative method of distributed machine learning to chemical compound data from open sources, called data collaboration analysis (DC). We also proposed data collaboration analysis using projection data (DCPd), which is an improved method that utilizes auxiliary PubChem data. This improves the quality of individual user-side data transformations for the projection data for the creation of intermediate representations.

To address this issue, we present ZADU, a Python library that provides distortion measures. ZADU is not only easy to install and execute but also enables comprehensive evaluation of DR embeddings through three key features. First, the library covers a wide range of distortion measures. Second, it automatically optimizes the execution of distortion measures, substantially reducing the running time required to execute multiple measures.

Currently, current stress of the DAB converter has been an important performance indicator when TPS modulation is applied for smaller size and higher efficiency. However, to minimize the current stress when the DAB converter is under TPS modulation, two difficulties exist in analysis process and realization process, respectively. Firstly, three degrees of modulation variables in TPS modulation bring challenges to the analysis of current stress in different operating modes. This analysis and deduction process leads to heavy computational burden and also suffers from low accuracy. Secondly, to realize TPS modulation, if a lookup table is adopted after the optimization of modulation variables, modulation performance will be unsatisfactory because of the discrete nature of lookup table.

When basing planning or prediction of real grasps on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.
