We call these \\textit{multi-attacks}. Characterizing the maximum $n$ we can achieve under different conditions such as image resolution, we estimate the number of regions of high class confidence around a particular image in the space of pixels to be around $10^{\\mathcal{O}(100)}$, posing a significant problem for exhaustive defense strategies. We show several immediate consequences of this: adversarial attacks that change the resulting class based on their intensity, and scale-independent adversarial examples. To demonstrate the redundancy and richness of class decision boundaries in the pixel space, we look for its two-dimensional sections that trace images and spell words using particular classes.

To address such challenges, we propose ReCLIP, the first source-free domain adaptation method for vision-language models, which does not require any source data or target labeled data. ReCLIP first learns a projection space to mitigate the misaligned visual-text embeddings and learns pseudo labels, and then deploys cross-modality self-training with the pseudo labels, to update visual and text encoders, refine labels and reduce domain gaps and misalignments iteratively.

This paper presents a novel framework called DiffCR, which leverages conditional guided diffusion with deep convolutional networks for high-performance cloud removal for optical satellite imagery.

This architecture is found to significantly outperform previously proposed neural networks when predicting Hamiltonian dynamics especially in potentials which contain multiple parameters. We demonstrate its robustness using the nonlinear Henon-Heiles potential under chaotic, quasiperiodic and periodic conditions. The second problem we tackle is whether we can use the high dimensional nonlinear capabilities of neural networks to predict the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system given only partial information of the same. Hence we attempt to take advantage of Long Short Term Memory networks to implement Takens' embedding theorem and construct a delay embedding of the system followed by mapping the topologically invariant attractor to the true form.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, called adaptive-experience replay (AdaER), to address the challenge of continual lifelong learning. AdaER consists of two stages: memory replay and memory update. In the memory replay stage, AdaER introduces a contextually-cued memory recall (C-CMR) strategy, which selectively replays memories that are most conflicting with the current input data in terms of both data and task. Additionally, AdaER incorporates an entropy-balanced reservoir sampling (E-BRS) strategy to enhance the performance of the memory buffer by maximizing information entropy. To evaluate the effectiveness of AdaER, we conduct experiments on established supervised continual lifelong learning benchmarks, specifically focusing on class-incremental learning scenarios.

While it may be possible for human experts to identify strategies manually in classroom settings with sufficient student interaction, it is not possible to scale this up to big data. Therefore, we leverage advances in Machine Learning and AI methods to perform scalable strategy prediction that is also fair to students at all skill levels. Specifically, we develop an embedding called MVec where we learn a representation based on the mastery of students. We then cluster these embeddings with a non-parametric clustering method where we progressively learn clusters such that we group together instances that have approximately symmetrical strategies. The strategy prediction model is trained on instances sampled from these clusters. This ensures that we train the model over diverse strategies and also that strategies from a particular group do not bias the DNN model, thus allowing it to optimize its parameters over all groups. Using real world large-scale student interaction datasets from MATHia, we implement our approach using transformers and Node2Vec for learning the mastery embeddings and LSTMs for predicting strategies.

Given a gate-level netlist of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure, connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing. When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on. The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning frameworks.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03944"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.03945", "Date": "Mon, 07 Aug 2023 23:27:20 ", "Title": "The Prospect of Enhancing Large-Scale Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Transformers", "Authors": ["Yulan Gao", "Hao Sun", "Zengxiang Li", "Han Yu"], "Categories": "cs.LG"}, "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy concerns by enabling collaborative training of AI models across distributed data owners.

Unfortunately, current evaluation protocols typically used to assess classifiers fail to comprehensively evaluate performance as they tend to rely on limited types of test data, and ignore others.

On the other hand, testing with data containing samples from unknown classes fails to evaluate how well the classifier can predict the labels for known classes. This article advocates bench-marking performance using a wide range of different types of data and using a single metric that can be applied to all such data types to produce a consistent evaluation of performance. Using such a benchmark it is found that current deep neural networks, including those trained with methods that are believed to produce state-of-the-art robustness, are extremely vulnerable to making mistakes on certain types of data.

According to it, one can explain, for example, an XAI's decision by addressing its dual nature: by focusing on the Architecture (e.g., the logic of its algorithms) or the Relevance (e.g., the severity of a decision, the implications of a recommendation). We investigated 20 game explanations using the theory as an analytical framework. We elaborate how we used the theory to quickly structure and compare explanations of technological artifacts. We supplemented results from analyzing the explanation contents with results from a video recall to explore how explainers justified their explanation. We found that explainers were focusing on the physical aspects of the game first (Architecture) and only later on aspects of the Relevance. Reasoning in the video recalls indicated that EX regarded the focus on the Architecture as important for structuring the explanation initially by explaining the basic components before focusing on more complex, intangible aspects.

However, how to effectively leverage rich temporal cues and fuse two heterogeneous visual streams remains a challenging endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose a novel streaming object detector with Transformer, namely SODFormer, which first integrates events and frames to continuously detect objects in an asynchronous manner. Technically, we first build a large-scale multimodal neuromorphic object detection dataset (i.e., PKU-DAVIS-SOD) over 1080.1k manual labels. Then, we design a spatiotemporal Transformer architecture to detect objects via an end-to-end sequence prediction problem, where the novel temporal Transformer module leverages rich temporal cues from two visual streams to improve the detection performance. Finally, an asynchronous attention-based fusion module is proposed to integrate two heterogeneous sensing modalities and take complementary advantages from each end, which can be queried at any time to locate objects and break through the limited output frequency from synchronized frame-based fusion strategies. The results show that the proposed SODFormer outperforms four state-of-the-art methods and our eight baselines by a significant margin.

The different routes taken by ATMA cause diverse patterns of time-varying capacity drops, which may affect the user equilibrium traffic assignment and lead to different system costs. This manuscript focuses on optimizing the routing for ATMA vehicles in a network to minimize the system cost associated with the slow-moving operation. To achieve this, a queuing-based traffic assignment approach is proposed to identify the system cost caused by the ATMA system. A queuing-based time-dependent (QBTD) travel time function, considering capacity drop, is introduced and applied in the static user equilibrium traffic assignment problem, with a result of adding dynamic characteristics. Subsequently, we formulate the queuing-based traffic assignment problem and solve it using a modified path-based algorithm. The methodology is validated using a small-size and a large-size network and compared with two benchmark models to analyze the benefit of capacity drop modeling and QBTD travel time function.

For example, our algorithm with only 8\\% labeled data is comparable to supervised adversarial training algorithms that use all labeled data, both in terms of standard and robust accuracies on CIFAR-10.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04061"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.04077", "Date": "Tue, 08 Aug 2023 06:26:54 ", "Title": "Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization using Trajectory-Informed Surrogate Gradients", "Authors": ["Yao Shu", "Xiaoqiang Lin", "Zhongxiang Dai", "Bryan Kian Hsiang Low"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI"}, "abstract": "Federated optimization, an emerging paradigm which finds wide real-world applications such as federated learning, enables multiple clients (e.g., edge devices) to collaboratively optimize a global function. The clients do not share their local datasets and typically only share their local gradients. However, the gradient information is not available in many applications of federated optimization, which hence gives rise to the paradigm of federated zeroth-order optimization (ZOO). Existing federated ZOO algorithms suffer from the limitations of query and communication inefficiency, which can be attributed to (a) their reliance on a substantial number of function queries for gradient estimation and (b) the significant disparity between their realized local updates and the intended global updates. To this end, we (a) introduce trajectory-informed gradient surrogates which is able to use the history of function queries during optimization for accurate and query-efficient gradient estimation, and (b) develop the technique of adaptive gradient correction using these gradient surrogates to mitigate the aforementioned disparity. Based on these, we propose the federated zeroth-order optimization using trajectory-informed surrogate gradients (FZooS) algorithm for query- and communication-efficient federated ZOO. Our FZooS achieves theoretical improvements over the existing approaches, which is supported by our real-world experiments such as federated black-box adversarial attack and federated non-differentiable metric optimization.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04077"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.04220", "Date": "Tue, 08 Aug 2023 12:34:32 ", "Title": "Semantic Interpretation and Validation of Graph Attention-based Explanations for GNN Models", "Authors": ["Efimia Panagiotaki", "Daniele De Martini", "Lars Kunze"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY cs.RO", "Comments": ["6 pages", "4 figures"], "ACM-class": "G.3; I.2.10; I.2.9; I.4.8; I.5.2; I.5.1"}, "abstract": "In this work, we propose a methodology for investigating the application of semantic attention to enhance the explainability of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models, introducing semantically-informed perturbations and establishing a correlation between predicted feature-importance weights and model accuracy. Graph Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged as a promising field for tasks like scene interpretation, leveraging flexible graph structures to concisely describe complex features and relationships. As traditional explainability methods used in eXplainable AI (XAI) cannot be directly applied to such structures, graph-specific approaches are introduced. Attention mechanisms have demonstrated their efficacy in estimating the importance of input features in deep learning models and thus have been previously employed to provide feature-based explanations for GNN predictions. Building upon these insights, we extend existing attention-based graph-explainability methods investigating the use of attention weights as importance indicators of semantically sorted feature sets. Through analysing the behaviour of predicted attention-weights distribution in correlation with model accuracy, we gain valuable insights into feature importance with respect to the behaviour of the GNN model.

Recently, Teacher-Student architectures have been effectively and widely embraced on various knowledge distillation (KD) objectives, including knowledge compression, knowledge expansion, knowledge adaptation, and knowledge enhancement. With the help of Teacher-Student architectures, current studies are able to achieve multiple distillation objectives through lightweight and generalized student networks. Different from existing KD surveys that primarily focus on knowledge compression, this survey first explores Teacher-Student architectures across multiple distillation objectives. This survey presents an introduction to various knowledge representations and their corresponding optimization objectives. Additionally, we provide a systematic overview of Teacher-Student architectures with representative learning algorithms and effective distillation schemes. This survey also summarizes recent applications of Teacher-Student architectures across multiple purposes, including classification, recognition, generation, ranking, and regression. Lastly, potential research directions in KD are investigated, focusing on architecture design, knowledge quality, and theoretical studies of regression-based learning, respectively.

PM has been successfully applied to process-oriented enterprise systems but is less suited for communication- and document-oriented Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS). ECS event logs are very fine-granular and PM applied to their logs results in spaghetti models. A common solution for this is event abstraction, i.e., converting low-level logs into more abstract high-level logs before running discovery algorithms. ECS logs come with special characteristics that have so far not been fully addressed by existing event abstraction approaches. We aim to close this gap with a tailored ECS event abstraction (ECSEA) approach that trains a model by comparing recorded actual user activities (high-level traces) with the system-generated low-level traces (extracted from the ECS). The model allows us to automatically convert future low-level traces into an abstracted high-level log that can be used for PM. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm produces accurate results.

In this work, we show how to leverage randomness and design models that are both expressive and invariant but use less resources. Inspired by randomized algorithms, our key insight is that accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of binary classification models called Randomized Linear Classifiers (RLCs). We give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets, graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic invariance and universality using less resources than (deterministic) neural networks and their invariant counterparts.

In complex environments with several obstacles and complicated geometry, this optimisation problem is usually difficult to solve and prone to local minima. However, recent advancements in computing hardware allow for parallel trajectory optimisation where multiple solutions are obtained simultaneously, each initialised from a different starting point. Unfortunately, without a strategy preventing two solutions to collapse on each other, naive parallel optimisation can suffer from mode collapse diminishing the efficiency of the approach and the likelihood of finding a global solution. In this paper we leverage on recent advances in the theory of rough paths to devise an algorithm for parallel trajectory optimisation that promotes diversity over the range of solutions, therefore avoiding mode collapses and achieving better global properties. Our approach builds on path signatures and Hilbert space representations of trajectories, and connects parallel variational inference for trajectory estimation with diversity promoting kernels. We empirically demonstrate that this strategy achieves lower average costs than competing alternatives on a range of problems, from 2D navigation to robotic manipulators operating in cluttered environments.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04071"}];
