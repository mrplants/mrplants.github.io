Even so, the resulting models will be geometry-specific, with learned scales that cannot be directly transferred across domains. Because of that, recent works focus instead on relative depth, eschewing scale in favor of improved up-to-scale zero-shot transfer. In this work we introduce ZeroDepth, a novel monocular depth estimation framework capable of predicting metric scale for arbitrary test images from different domains and camera parameters. This is achieved by (i) the use of input-level geometric embeddings that enable the network to learn a scale prior over objects; and (ii) decoupling the encoder and decoder stages, via a variational latent representation that is conditioned on single frame information. We evaluated ZeroDepth targeting both outdoor (KITTI, DDAD, nuScenes) and indoor (NYUv2) benchmarks, and achieved a new state-of-the-art in both settings using the same pre-trained model, outperforming methods that train on in-domain data and require test-time scaling to produce metric estimates.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17253"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17778", "Date": "Fri, 30 Jun 2023 16:31:14 ", "Title": "Look, Remember and Reason: Visual Reasoning with Grounded Rationales", "Authors": ["Apratim Bhattacharyya", "Sunny Panchal", "Mingu Lee", "Reza Pourreza", "Pulkit Madan", "Roland Memisevic"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.LG"}, "abstract": "Large language models have recently shown human level performance on a variety of reasoning tasks. However, the ability of these models to perform complex visual reasoning has not been studied in detail yet. A key challenge in many visual reasoning tasks is that the visual information needs to be tightly integrated in the reasoning process. We propose to address this challenge by drawing inspiration from human visual problem solving which depends on a variety of low-level visual capabilities. It can often be cast as the three step-process of ``Look, Remember, Reason'': visual information is incrementally extracted using low-level visual routines in a step-by-step fashion until a final answer is reached. We follow the same paradigm to enable existing large language models, with minimal changes to the architecture, to solve visual reasoning problems. To this end, we introduce rationales over the visual input that allow us to integrate low-level visual capabilities, such as object recognition and tracking, as surrogate tasks. We show competitive performance on diverse visual reasoning tasks from the CLEVR, CATER, and ACRE datasets over state-of-the-art models designed specifically for these tasks.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17778"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17829", "Date": "Fri, 30 Jun 2023 17:50:00 ", "Title": "Federated Ensemble YOLOv5 - A Better Generalized Object Detection Algorithm", "Authors": ["Vinit Hegiste", "Tatjana Legler and Martin Ruskowski"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.LG", "Comments": ["8 pages and submitted to FLTA2023 symposium under IEEE"]}, "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has gained significant traction as a privacy-preserving algorithm, but the underlying resembles of federated learning algorithm like Federated averaging (FED Avg) or Federated SGD (FED SGD) to ensemble learning algorithms has not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to examine the application of FL to object detection as a method to enhance generalizability, and to compare its performance against a centralized training approach for an object detection algorithm. Specifically, we investigate the performance of a YOLOv5 model trained using FL across multiple clients and employ a random sampling strategy without replacement, so each client holds a portion of the same dataset used for centralized training. Our experimental results showcase the superior efficiency of the FL object detector's global model in generating accurate bounding boxes for unseen objects, with the test set being a mixture of objects from two distinct clients not represented in the training dataset. These findings suggest that FL can be viewed from an ensemble algorithm perspective, akin to a synergistic blend of Bagging and Boosting techniques. As a result, FL can be seen not only as a method to enhance privacy, but also as a method to enhance the performance of a machine learning model.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17829"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17266", "Date": "Wed, 21 Jun 2023 16:02:52 ", "Title": "Subgraph Stationary Hardware-Software Inference Co-Design", "Authors": ["Payman Behnam", "Jianming Tong", "Alind Khare", "Yangyu Chen", "Yue Pan", "Pranav Gadikar", "Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya", "Tushar Krishna", "Alexey Tumanov"], "Categories": "cs.DC cs.LG", "Comments": ["16 pages; MLSYS 2023"]}, "abstract": "A growing number of applications depend on Machine Learning (ML) functionality and benefits from both higher quality ML predictions and better timeliness (latency) at the same time. A growing body of research in computer architecture, ML, and systems software literature focuses on reaching better latency-accuracy tradeoffs for ML models. Efforts include compression, quantization, pruning, early-exit models, mixed DNN precision, as well as ML inference accelerator designs that minimize latency and energy, while preserving delivered accuracy. All of them, however, yield improvements for a single static point in the latency-accuracy tradeoff space. We make a case for applications that operate in dynamically changing deployment scenarios, where no single static point is optimal. We draw on a recently proposed weight-shared SuperNet mechanism to enable serving a stream of queries that uses (activates) different SubNets within this weight-shared construct. This creates an opportunity to exploit the inherent temporal locality with our proposed SubGraph Stationary (SGS) optimization. We take a hardware-software co-design approach with a real implementation of SGS in SushiAccel and the implementation of a software scheduler SushiSched controlling which SubNets to serve and what to cache in real-time. Combined, they are vertically integrated into SUSHI-an inference serving stack. For the stream of queries, SUSHI yields up to 25% improvement in latency, 0.98% increase in served accuracy.

While contemporary techniques from deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provide effective solutions, their decision-making is not transparent. We aim to provide insights into the decisions faced by the agent by learning an automaton model of environmental behavior under the control of an agent. However, for most control problems, automata learning is not scalable enough to learn a useful model. In this work, we raise the capabilities of automata learning such that it is possible to learn models for environments that have complex and continuous dynamics. The core of the scalability of our method lies in the computation of an abstract state-space representation, by applying dimensionality reduction and clustering on the observed environmental state space. The stochastic transitions are learned via passive automata learning from observed interactions of the agent and the environment. In an iterative model-based RL process, we sample additional trajectories to learn an accurate environment model in the form of a discrete-state Markov decision process (MDP). We apply our automata learning framework on popular RL benchmarking environments in the OpenAI Gym, including LunarLander, CartPole, Mountain Car, and Acrobot. Our results show that the learned models are so precise that they enable the computation of policies solving the respective control tasks. Yet the models are more concise and more general than neural-network-based policies and by using MDPs we benefit from a wealth of tools available for analyzing them.

In this paper, we aim to speed up the convergence and enhance the resilience of state estimation and tracking using a simple hierarchical system architecture wherein agents are clusters into smaller networks, and a parameter server exists to aid the information exchanges among networks. The information exchange among networks is expensive and occurs only once in a while. We propose two consensus + innovation algorithms for the state estimation and tracking problems, respectively. In both algorithms, we use a novel hierarchical push-sum consensus component. For the state estimation, we use dual averaging as the local innovation component. State tracking is much harder to tackle in the presence of dropping-link failures and the standard integration of the consensus and innovation approaches are no longer applicable. Moreover, dual averaging is no longer feasible. Our algorithm introduces a pair of additional variables per link and ensure the relevant local variables evolve according to the state dynamics, and use projected local gradient descent as the local innovation component. We also characterize the convergence rates of both of the algorithms under linear local observation model and minimal technical assumptions.

This has led to considerable interest in their formal analysis, aiming to provide guarantees regarding a given NN's behavior. Existing frameworks provide robustness and/or safety guarantees for the trained NNs, using satisfiability solving and linear programming. We proposed FANNet, the first model checking-based framework for analyzing a broader range of NN properties.

This work develops state-space reduction and input segmentation approaches, to improve the scalability and timing efficiency of formal NN analysis. Compared to the state-of-the-art FANNet, this enables our new model checking-based framework to reduce the verification's timing overhead by a factor of up to 8000, making the framework applicable to NNs even with approximately $80$ times more network parameters.

Compared to competitive methods that rely on external, often unlabeled, datasets of real images, our approach can generate synthetic samples belonging to the same classes as the previously encountered images. This allows us to use those additional data samples not only in the distillation loss but also for replay in the classification loss. Experiments on the competitive benchmarks CIFAR100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet demonstrate how this new approach can be used to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning on large scale datasets.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17560"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17630", "Date": "Fri, 30 Jun 2023 13:04:26 ", "Title": "Impact of Noise on Calibration and Generalisation of Neural Networks", "Authors": ["Martin Ferianc", "Ondrej Bohdal", "Timothy Hospedales", "Miguel Rodrigues"], "Categories": "cs.LG", "Comments": ["Accepted at the ICML 2023 Workshop on Spurious Correlations", "Invariance", "and Stability.

However, instead of having direct access to the distances in the metric space, each voter gives us a ranked list of the candidates in order of distance. Can we design a rule that regardless of the election instance and underlying metric space, chooses a candidate whose cost differs from the true optimum by only a small factor (known as the distortion)? A long line of work culminated in finding deterministic voting rules with metric distortion $3$, which is the best possible for deterministic rules and many other classes of voting rules. However, without any restrictions, there is still a significant gap in our understanding: Even though the best lower bound is substantially lower at $2.112$, the best upper bound is still $3$, which is attained even by simple rules such as Random Dictatorship. Finding a rule that guarantees distortion $3 - \\varepsilon$ for some constant $\\varepsilon $ has been a major challenge in computational social choice. In this work, we give a rule that guarantees distortion less than $2.753$. To do so we study a handful of voting rules that are new to the problem. One is Maximal Lotteries, a rule based on the Nash equilibrium of a natural zero-sum game which dates back to the 60's.

However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point distances in Euclidean space.

In this paper, we present a study on the necessary components for decision-aware reinforcement learning models and we showcase design choices that enable well-performing algorithms. To this end, we provide a theoretical and empirical investigation into prominent algorithmic ideas in the field. We highlight that empirical design decisions established in the MuZero line of works are vital to achieving good performance for related algorithms, and we showcase differences in behavior between different instantiations of value-aware algorithms in stochastic environments.

This is an important yet relatively unexplored task. We look into this problem through the lens of the training data - one of the major sources of unfairness. We ask the following questions: how would a model's fairness performance change if, in its training data, some samples (1) were collected from a different (e.g. demographic) group, (2) were labeled differently, or (3) some features were changed? In other words, we quantify the fairness influence of training samples by counterfactually intervening and changing samples based on predefined concepts, i.e. data attributes such as features (X), labels (Y), or sensitive attributes (A). To calculate a training sample's influence on the model's unfairness w.r.t a concept, we first generate counterfactual samples based on the concept, i.e. the counterfactual versions of the sample if the concept were changed. We then calculate the resulting impact on the unfairness, via influence function, if the counterfactual samples were used in training. Our framework not only helps practitioners understand the observed unfairness and repair their training data, but also leads to many other applications, e.g. detecting mislabeling, fixing imbalanced representations, and detecting fairness-targeted poisoning attacks.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17828"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17833", "Date": "Fri, 30 Jun 2023 17:53:50 ", "Title": "Resetting the Optimizer in Deep RL: An Empirical Study", "Authors": ["Kavosh Asadi", "Rasool Fakoor", "Shoham Sabach"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI"}, "abstract": "We focus on the task of approximating the optimal value function in deep reinforcement learning. This iterative process is comprised of approximately solving a sequence of optimization problems where the objective function can change per iteration. The common approach to solving the problem is to employ modern variants of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm such as Adam. These optimizers maintain their own internal parameters such as estimates of the first and the second moment of the gradient, and update these parameters over time. Therefore, information obtained in previous iterations is being used to solve the optimization problem in the current iteration. We hypothesize that this can contaminate the internal parameters of the employed optimizer in situations where the optimization landscape of the previous iterations is quite different from the current iteration. To hedge against this effect, a simple idea is to reset the internal parameters of the optimizer when starting a new iteration. We empirically investigate this resetting strategy by employing various optimizers in conjunction with the Rainbow algorithm. We demonstrate that this simple modification unleashes the true potential of modern optimizers, and significantly improves the performance of deep RL on the Atari benchmark.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17833"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2306.17529", "Date": "Fri, 30 Jun 2023 10:34:56 ", "Title": "Locking On: Leveraging Dynamic Vehicle-Imposed Motion Constraints to Improve Visual Localization", "Authors": ["Stephen Hausler", "Sourav Garg", "Punarjay Chakravarty", "Shubham Shrivastava", "Ankit Vora", "Michael Milford"], "Categories": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "Comments": ["Accepted to IROS 2023"]}, "abstract": "Most 6-DoF localization and SLAM systems use static landmarks but ignore dynamic objects because they cannot be usefully incorporated into a typical pipeline.

In this research, we propose a middle ground, demonstrated in the context of autonomous vehicles, using dynamic vehicles to provide limited pose constraint information in a 6-DoF frame-by-frame PnP-RANSAC localization pipeline. We refine initial pose estimates with a motion model and propose a method for calculating the predicted quality of future pose estimates, triggered based on whether or not the autonomous vehicle's motion is constrained by the relative frame-to-frame location of dynamic vehicles in the environment. Our approach detects and identifies suitable dynamic vehicles to define these pose constraints to modify a pose filter, resulting in improved recall across a range of localization tolerances from $0.25m$ to $5m$, compared to a state-of-the-art baseline single image PnP method and its vanilla pose filtering.

Many manipulation tasks require high spatial precision in end-effector pose prediction, typically demanding high-resolution 3D perceptual grids that are computationally expensive to process. As a result, most manipulation policies operate directly in 2D, foregoing 3D inductive biases. In this paper, we propose Act3D, a manipulation policy Transformer that casts 6-DoF keypose prediction as 3D detection with adaptive spatial computation. It takes as input 3D feature clouds unprojected from one or more camera views, iteratively samples 3D point grids in free space in a coarse-to-fine manner, featurizes them using relative spatial attention to the physical feature cloud, and selects the best feature point for end-effector pose prediction. Act3D sets a new state-of-the-art in RLbench, an established manipulation benchmark. Our model achieves 10% absolute improvement over the previous SOTA 2D multi-view policy on 74 RLbench tasks and 22% absolute improvement with 3x less compute over the previous SOTA 3D policy. In thorough ablations, we show the importance of relative spatial attention, large-scale vision-language pre-trained 2D backbones, and weight tying across coarse-to-fine attentions.
