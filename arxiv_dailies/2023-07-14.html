In this paper, we solve AVEL in a weakly-supervised setting, where only video-level event labels (their presence/absence, but not their locations in time) are available as supervision for training. Our idea is to use a base model to estimate labels on the training data at a finer temporal resolution than at the video level and re-train the model with these labels. I.e., we determine the subset of labels for each \\emph{slice} of frames in a training video by (i) replacing the frames outside the slice with those from a second video having no overlap in video-level labels, and (ii) feeding this synthetic video into the base model to extract labels for just the slice in question. To handle the out-of-distribution nature of our synthetic videos, we propose an auxiliary objective for the base model that induces more reliable predictions of the localized event labels as desired.

However, most existing encoders are limited to a single-class domain, which hinders their ability to handle diverse concepts. In this work, we propose a domain-agnostic method that does not require any specialized dataset or prior information about the personalized concepts. We introduce a novel contrastive-based regularization technique to maintain high fidelity to the target concept characteristics while keeping the predicted embeddings close to editable regions of the latent space, by pushing the predicted tokens toward their nearest existing CLIP tokens.

Our method identifies agent dynamics through polynomial regression, where we compensate for limited data by incorporating side-information constraints that capture fundamental assumptions or expectations about agent behavior. These constraints are enforced computationally using sum-of-squares optimization, leading to a hierarchy of increasingly better approximations of the true agent dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach, using only 5 samples from a short run of a single trajectory, accurately recovers the true dynamics across various benchmarks, including equilibrium selection and prediction of chaotic systems up to 10 Lyapunov times.

This paper introduces a two-stage framework leveraging representation learning and personalization to improve anomaly detection performance in PPG data. The proposed framework first employs representation learning to transform the original PPG signals into a more discriminative and compact representation. We then apply three different unsupervised anomaly detection methods for movement detection and biometric identification. We validate our approach using two different datasets in both generalized and personalized scenarios. The results show that representation learning significantly improves anomaly detection performance while reducing the high inter-subject variability. Personalized models further enhance anomaly detection performance, underscoring the role of personalization in PPG-based fitness-health monitoring systems.

In particular, computations requiring complex memory storage and retrieval pose a significant challenge for these networks to implement or learn. Recently, a family of models described by neural ordinary differential equations (nODEs) has emerged as powerful dynamical neural network models capable of capturing complex dynamics. Here, we extend nODEs by endowing them with adaptive timescales using gating interactions. We refer to these as gated neural ODEs (gnODEs). Using a task that requires memory of continuous quantities, we demonstrate the inductive bias of the gnODEs to learn (approximate) continuous attractors. We further show how reduced-dimensional gnODEs retain their modeling power while greatly improving interpretability, even allowing explicit visualization of the structure of learned attractors. We introduce a novel measure of expressivity which probes the capacity of a neural network to generate complex trajectories. Using this measure, we explore how the phase-space dimension of the nODEs and the complexity of the function modeling the flow field contribute to expressivity. We see that a more complex function for modeling the flow field allows a lower-dimensional nODE to capture a given target dynamics.

However, graph learning methods expose sensitive user information and interactions not only through their model parameters but also through their model predictions. Consequently, standard Differential Privacy (DP) techniques that merely offer model weight privacy are inadequate. This is especially the case for node predictions that leverage neighboring node attributes directly via graph convolutions that create additional risks of privacy leakage. To address this problem, we introduce Graph Differential Privacy (GDP), a new formal DP framework tailored to graph learning settings that ensures both provably private model parameters and predictions. Furthermore, since there may be different privacy requirements for the node attributes and graph structure, we introduce a novel notion of relaxed node-level data adjacency. This relaxation can be used for establishing guarantees for different degrees of graph topology privacy while maintaining node attribute privacy. Importantly, this relaxation reveals a useful trade-off between utility and topology privacy for graph learning methods. In addition, our analysis of GDP reveals that existing DP-GNNs fail to exploit this trade-off due to the complex interplay between graph topology and attribute data in standard graph convolution designs. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolution (DPDGC) model, which benefits from decoupled graph convolution while providing GDP guarantees. Extensive experiments on seven node classification benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superior privacy-utility trade-off of DPDGC over existing DP-GNNs based on standard graph convolution design.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06422"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.06442", "Date": "Wed, 12 Jul 2023 20:11:50 ", "Title": "On Collaboration in Distributed Parameter Estimation with Resource Constraints", "Authors": ["Yu-Zhen Janice Chen", "Daniel S.

When the knowledge of correlation between variables is available, we analytically identify two particular scenarios: (1) where the knowledge of the correlation between samples cannot be leveraged for collaborative estimation purposes and (2) where the optimal data collection policy involves investing scarce resources to collaboratively sample and transfer information that is not of immediate interest and whose statistics are already known, with the sole goal of increasing the confidence on the estimate of the parameter of interest.

In this work, we develop a series of theoretical results that enable bilinear combinatorial extrapolation under gradual spectral decay as observed in typical high-dimensional data, including novel algorithms, generalization guarantees, and linear-algebraic results.

In this work, we propose DSV (Discordance and Separability Validation), an unsupervised validation loss to select high-performing detection models with effective augmentation HPs. DSV captures the alignment between an augmentation function and the anomaly-generating mechanism with surrogate losses, which approximate the discordance and separability of test data, respectively.

A minimum spanning tree is then employed for calculating the shortest path to explore the crack which is then used to develop the motion planner for the robotic manipulator. The motion planner divides the crack into multiple nodes which are then explored individually.

Conversely, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides personalized and adaptive strategies but faces challenges with distribution shifts and substantial data requirements. Methods: We propose a hybrid control policy for the artificial pancreas (HyCPAP) to address the above challenges. HyCPAP combines an MPC policy with an ensemble DRL policy, leveraging the strengths of both policies while compensating for their respective limitations. To facilitate faster deployment of AP systems in real-world settings, we further incorporate meta-learning techniques into HyCPAP, leveraging previous experience and patient-shared knowledge to enable fast adaptation to new patients with limited available data. Results: We conduct extensive experiments using the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1DM simulator across three scenarios. Our approaches achieve the highest percentage of time spent in the desired euglycemic range and the lowest occurrences of hypoglycemia. Conclusion: The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our methods for closed-loop glucose management in individuals with T1DM. Significance: The study presents novel control policies for AP systems, affirming the great potential of proposed methods for efficient closed-loop glucose control.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06501"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.06513", "Date": "Thu, 13 Jul 2023 01:22:18 ", "Title": "Leveraging Contextual Counterfactuals Toward Belief Calibration", "Authors": ["Qiuyi (Richard) Zhang", "Michael S.

Specifically, in high regret situations, we observe that contextual counterfactuals and recourse costs are particularly important in updating a decision maker's beliefs and the strengths to which such beliefs are held. Therefore, we argue that including counterfactuals is key to an accurate calibration of beliefs during alignment. To do this, we first segment belief diversity into two categories: subjectivity (across individuals within a population) and epistemic uncertainty (within an individual across different contexts). By leveraging our notion of epistemic uncertainty, we introduce `the belief calibration cycle' framework to more holistically calibrate this diversity of beliefs with context-driven counterfactual reasoning by using a multi-objective optimization.

These interventions are triggered according to an intervention policy. Reinforcement learning has been put forward as an approach to learning intervention policies through trial and error. Existing approaches in this space assume that the number of resources available to perform interventions in a process is unlimited, an unrealistic assumption in practice. This paper argues that, in the presence of resource constraints, a key dilemma in the field of prescriptive process monitoring is to trigger interventions based not only on predictions of their necessity, timeliness, or effect but also on the uncertainty of these predictions and the level of resource utilization. Indeed, committing scarce resources to an intervention when the necessity or effects of this intervention are highly uncertain may intuitively lead to suboptimal intervention effects. Accordingly, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for prescriptive process monitoring that leverages conformal prediction techniques to consider the uncertainty of the predictions upon which an intervention decision is based. An evaluation using real-life datasets demonstrates that explicitly modeling uncertainty using conformal predictions helps reinforcement learning agents converge towards policies with higher net intervention gain", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06564"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.06698", "Date": "Thu, 13 Jul 2023 11:54:32 ", "Title": "IntelliGraphs: Datasets for Benchmarking Knowledge Graph Generation", "Authors": ["Thiviyan Thanapalasingam", "Emile van Krieken", "Peter Bloem", "Paul Groth"], "Categories": "cs.AI cs.LG"}, "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models are used to learn continuous representations of entities and relations.

Although previous studies have shown high attack success rates, coupling DNN models with interpretation models could offer a sense of security when a human expert is involved, who can identify whether a given sample is benign or malicious. However, in white-box environments, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) have been shown to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations. In black-box settings, as access to the components of IDLSes is limited, it becomes more challenging for the adversary to fool the system. In this work, we propose a Query-efficient Score-based black-box attack against IDLSes, QuScore, which requires no knowledge of the target model and its coupled interpretation model. QuScore is based on transfer-based and score-based methods by employing an effective microbial genetic algorithm. Our method is designed to reduce the number of queries necessary to carry out successful attacks, resulting in a more efficient process. By continuously refining the adversarial samples created based on feedback scores from the IDLS, our approach effectively navigates the search space to identify perturbations that can fool the system. We evaluate the attack's effectiveness on four CNN models (Inception, ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) and two interpretation models (CAM, Grad), using both ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach is query-efficient with a high attack success rate that can reach between 95% and 100% and transferability with an average success rate of 69% in the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets.

Harnessing the concept of non-robust features, we elaborate on two guiding principles for surrogate model selection to explain why the foundational model is an optimal choice for this role.

Analyzing this unexpected behavior within the feature space, we attribute the lackluster performance of foundational models (e.g., CLIP) to their significant representational capacity and, conversely, their lack of discriminative prowess. To mitigate this issue, we propose the use of a margin-based loss strategy for the fine-tuning of foundational models on target images.

We prove a worst-case complexity result, which we believe captures this challenge: Modifying the probabilities or the reward of a single state-action pair in a reinforcement learning problem requires an amount of time almost as large as the number of states in order to keep the value function up to date, unless the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) is false; SETH is a widely accepted strengthening of the P $\\neq$ NP conjecture. Recall that the number of states in current applications of reinforcement learning is typically astronomical. In contrast, we show that just $\\textit{adding}$ a new state-action pair is considerably easier to implement.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06877"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.06913", "Date": "Thu, 13 Jul 2023 17:21:54 ", "Title": "Uncovering Unique Concept Vectors through Latent Space Decomposition", "Authors": ["Mara Graziani", "Laura O' Mahony", "An-Phi Nguyen", "Henning M\\\"uller", "Vincent Andrearczyk"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV"}, "abstract": "Interpreting the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for establishing trust and ensuring model safety. Concept-based explanations have emerged as a superior approach that is more interpretable than feature attribution estimates such as pixel saliency. However, defining the concepts for the interpretability analysis biases the explanations by the user's expectations on the concepts. To address this, we propose a novel post-hoc unsupervised method that automatically uncovers the concepts learned by deep models during training. By decomposing the latent space of a layer in singular vectors and refining them by unsupervised clustering, we uncover concept vectors aligned with directions of high variance that are relevant to the model prediction, and that point to semantically distinct concepts. Our extensive experiments reveal that the majority of our concepts are readily understandable to humans, exhibit coherency, and bear relevance to the task at hand. Moreover, we showcase the practical utility of our method in dataset exploration, where our concept vectors successfully identify outlier training samples affected by various confounding factors. This novel exploration technique has remarkable versatility to data types and model architectures and it will facilitate the identification of biases and the discovery of sources of error within training data.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06913"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.06933", "Date": "Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:04:28 ", "Title": "FDAPT: Federated Domain-adaptive Pre-training for Language Models", "Authors": ["Lekang Jiang", "Filip Svoboda", "Nicholas D.

We demonstrate that FDAPT can maintain competitive downstream task performance to the centralized baseline in both IID and non-IID situations. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm, Frozen Federated Domain-adaptive Pre-training (FFDAPT). FFDAPT improves the computational efficiency by 12.1% on average and exhibits similar downstream task performance to standard FDAPT, with general performance fluctuations remaining less than 1%.

Exploiting the modularity of TAMP systems, we develop a generative mixture model that produces candidate continuous parameters for a planner. Whereas most existing lifelong learning approaches determine a priori how data is shared across task models, our approach learns shared and non-shared models and determines which to use online during planning based on auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy for each model's understanding of a state.

By understanding the commands from the user, DRAGON is able to guide the user to the desired landmarks on the map, describe the environment, and answer questions from visual observations. Through effective utilization of dialogue, the robot can ground the user's free-form descriptions to landmarks in the environment, and give the user semantic information through spoken language.

Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order fulfillment ratio.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06742"}];
