Many different architectures have been proposed for the semantic segmentation task and UNet being one of them. In this thesis, we propose a novel architecture based on Google's newly proposed EfficientNetV2 as an encoder for feature extraction with UNet decoder for constructing the segmentation map.

Earlier studies have extended SGMs to tackle class-conditional generation by coupling an unconditional SGM with the guidance of a trained classifier. Nevertheless, such classifier-guided SGMs do not always achieve accurate conditional generation, especially when trained with fewer labeled data. We argue that the issue is rooted in unreliable gradients of the classifier and the inability to fully utilize unlabeled data during training. We then propose to improve classifier-guided SGMs by letting the classifier calibrate itself. Our key idea is to use principles from energy-based models to convert the classifier as another view of the unconditional SGM. Then, existing loss for the unconditional SGM can be adopted to calibrate the classifier using both labeled and unlabeled data. Empirical results validate that the proposed approach significantly improves the conditional generation quality across different percentages of labeled data. The improved performance makes the proposed approach consistently superior to other conditional SGMs when using fewer labeled data.

At the same time, recent works in joint visual language models such as CLIP provide ways to specify natural language descriptions of image classes but typically focus on providing single descriptions for each class. In this work, we demonstrate that an alternative approach, arguably more akin to our understanding of multiple ``visual features'' per class, can also provide compelling performance in the robust few-shot learning setting. In particular, we automatically enumerate multiple visual descriptions of each class -- via a large language model (LLM) -- then use a vision-image model to translate these descriptions to a set of multiple visual features of each image; we finally use sparse logistic regression to select a relevant subset of these features to classify each image. This both provides an ``intuitive'' set of relevant features for each class, and in the few-shot learning setting, outperforms standard approaches such as linear probing.

Nonetheless, deploying these models on low-capability devices still requires an effective approach, such as model pruning. However, pruning the model from scratch can pose a practical challenge given the limited resources of each downstream task or device. To tackle this issue, we present a scalable one-shot pruning method that leverages pruned knowledge of similar tasks to extract a sub-network from the pre-trained model for a new task. Specifically, we create a score mask using the pruned models of similar tasks to identify task-specific filters/nodes in the pre-trained model for the new task. Based on this mask, we conduct a single round of pruning to extract a suitably-sized sub-network that can quickly adapt to the new task with only a few training iterations.

Adversarial training is one approach to strengthening DNNs against adversarial attacks, and has been shown to offer a means for doing so at the cost of applying computationally expensive training methods to the entire model. To better understand these attacks and facilitate more efficient adversarial training, in this paper we develop a novel theoretical framework that investigates how the adversarial robustness of a subnetwork contributes to the robustness of the entire network. To do so we first introduce the concept of semirobustness, which is a measure of the adversarial robustness of a subnetwork. Building on this concept, we then provide a theoretical analysis to show that if a subnetwork is semirobust and there is a sufficient dependency between it and each subsequent layer in the network, then the remaining layers are also guaranteed to be robust. We validate these findings empirically across multiple DNN architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks.

Over the years, numerous studies have attempted to construct a crash likelihood prediction model in order to enhance traffic safety, but mostly on freeways. In the majority of the existing studies, researchers have primarily employed a deep learning-based framework to identify crash potential. Lately, Transformer has emerged as a potential deep neural network that fundamentally operates through attention-based mechanisms. Transformer has several functional benefits over extant deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), etc. Firstly, Transformer can readily handle long-term dependencies in a data sequence. Secondly, Transformer can parallelly process all elements in a data sequence during training. Finally, Transformer does not have the vanishing gradient issue. Realizing the immense possibility of Transformer, this paper proposes inTersection-Transformer (inTformer), a time-embedded attention-based Transformer model that can effectively predict intersection crash likelihood in real-time. The proposed model was evaluated using connected vehicle data extracted from INRIX's Signal Analytics Platform. The data was parallelly formatted and stacked at different timesteps to develop nine inTformer models. The best inTformer model achieved a sensitivity of 73%. This model was also compared to earlier studies on crash likelihood prediction at intersections and with several established deep learning models trained on the same connected vehicle dataset.

Both challenges involve modeling long-term dependencies. The transformer architecture has been very successful to solve problems that involve long-term dependencies, including in the RL domain. However, the underlying reason for the strong performance of Transformer-based RL methods remains unclear: is it because they learn effective memory, or because they perform effective credit assignment? After introducing formal definitions of memory length and credit assignment length, we design simple configurable tasks to measure these distinct quantities. Our empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capacity of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago. However, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment.

For constrained inference, we show that it reduces the population risk by correcting a model's violation, and hence turns the violation into an advantage.

Guided by the distributed information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition sorts variation in the measurements of the system state by relevance to specified macroscale behavior, revealing the most important subsets of measurements for different amounts of predictive information. Additional granularity is achieved by inspection of the learned compression schemes: the variation transmitted during compression is composed of distinctions among measurement values that are most relevant to the macroscale behavior.

In both examples, specific bits of entropy are identified out of the high entropy of the system state as most related to macroscale behavior for insight about the connection between micro- and macro- in the complex system.

An economical workaround only samples a small portion of frames to represent the main content of that video and tune an image--text model on these sampled frames. Recent video understanding models usually randomly sample a set of frames or clips, regardless of internal correlations between their visual contents, nor their relevance to the problem. We argue that such kinds of aimless sampling may omit the key frames from which the correct answer can be deduced, and the situation gets worse when the sampling sparsity increases, which always happens as the video lengths increase.

The paper formulates the DLPP as a MIP and shows that it admits a large number of symmetries in a network where each commodity can be routed through primary and alternate paths. As a result, an optimization solver may return fundamentally different solutions to closely related problems, confusing planners and reducing trust in optimization. To remedy this limitation, the paper proposes a Goal-Directed Optimization that eliminates those symmetries by generating optimal solutions staying close to a reference plan. The paper also proposes an optimization proxy to address the computational challenges of the optimization models. The proxy combines a machine learning model and a feasibility restoration model and finds solutions that satisfy real-time constraints imposed by planners-in-the-loop. An extensive computational study on industrial instances shows that the optimization proxy is around 10 times faster than the commercial solver in obtaining the same quality solutions and orders of magnitude faster for generating solutions that are consistent with each other. The proposed approach also demonstrates the benefits of the DLPP for load consolidation, and the significant savings obtained from combining machine learning and optimization.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04050"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.04336", "Date": "Mon, 10 Jul 2023 04:22:49 ", "Title": "Source-Aware Embedding Training on Heterogeneous Information Networks", "Authors": ["Tsai Hor Chan", "Chi Ho Wong", "Jiajun Shen", "Guosheng Yin"], "Categories": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI", "Comments": ["Published in Data Intelligence 2023"], "DOI": "10.1162/dint_a_00200"}, "abstract": "Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have been extensively applied to real-world tasks, such as recommendation systems, social networks, and citation networks.

This work suggests that tying copyright liability to the capabilities of the model may be useful given the evolving ecosystem of generative models. Specifically, much of the legal analysis of copyright and generative systems focuses on the use of protected data for training. As a result, the connections between data, training, and the system are often obscured. In our approach, we consider simple image classification techniques to measure a model's ability to imitate specific artists. Specifically, we use Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained (CLIP) encoders to classify images in a zero-shot fashion. Our process first prompts a model to imitate a specific artist. Then, we test whether CLIP can be used to reclassify the artist (or the artist's work) from the imitation. If these tests match the imitation back to the original artist, this suggests the model can imitate that artist's expression. Our approach is simple and quantitative. Furthermore, it uses standard techniques and does not require additional training. We demonstrate our approach with an audit of Stable Diffusion's capacity to imitate 70 professional digital artists with copyrighted work online. When Stable Diffusion is prompted to imitate an artist from this set, we find that the artist can be identified from the imitation with an average accuracy of 81.0%.

Moreover, the depth of the graph network can be used to adapt the extent of contextual spread to the target dataset, thereby being able to explicitly control the added computational cost.

To address these problems, in this paper we explore a simple yet effective decompositional approach towards both evaluation and improvement of text-to-image alignment. In particular, we first introduce a Decompositional-Alignment-Score which given a complex prompt decomposes it into a set of disjoint assertions. The alignment of each assertion with generated images is then measured using a VQA model. Finally, alignment scores for different assertions are combined aposteriori to give the final text-to-image alignment score. Experimental analysis reveals that the proposed alignment metric shows significantly higher correlation with human ratings as opposed to traditional CLIP, BLIP scores. Furthermore, we also find that the assertion level alignment scores provide a useful feedback which can then be used in a simple iterative procedure to gradually increase the expression of different assertions in the final image outputs.

Despite progress in this field, much of the focus has been on point anomalies and contextual anomalies, with lesser attention paid to collective anomalies. A less addressed but common variant of collective anomalies is when the abnormal collective behavior is caused by shifts in interrelationships within the system. This can be due to abnormal environmental conditions like overheating, improper operational settings resulting from cyber-physical attacks, or system-level faults.

DyGATAD incorporates an operating condition-aware reconstruction combined with a topology-based anomaly score, thereby enhancing the detection ability of relationship shifts. We evaluate the performance of DyGATAD using both a synthetic dataset with controlled varying fault severity levels and an industrial-scale multiphase flow facility benchmark featuring various fault types with different detection difficulties.

The first two steps are reward-based reweighting and reselection, which align prototypes with human feedback. The final step is retraining to realign the model's features with the updated prototypes.

In this study, we proposed a generalization framework based on attention mechanisms for unsupervised contrastive learning (AMUCL) to analyze cancer multi-omics data for the identification and characterization of cancer subtypes. AMUCL framework includes a unsupervised multi-head attention mechanism, which deeply extracts multi-omics data features. Importantly, a decoupled contrastive learning model (DMACL) based on a multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to learn multi-omics data features and clusters and identify new cancer subtypes. This unsupervised contrastive learning method clusters subtypes by calculating the similarity between samples in the feature space and sample space of multi-omics data. Compared to 11 other deep learning models, the DMACL model achieved a C-index of 0.002, a Silhouette score of 0.801, and a Davies Bouldin Score of 0.38 on a single-cell multi-omics dataset. On a cancer multi-omics dataset, the DMACL model obtained a C-index of 0.016, a Silhouette score of 0.688, and a Davies Bouldin Score of 0.46, and obtained the most reliable cancer subtype clustering results for each type of cancer. Finally, we used the DMACL model in the AMUCL framework to reveal six cancer subtypes of AML. By analyzing the GO functional enrichment, subtype-specific biological functions, and GSEA of AML, we further enhanced the interpretability of cancer subtype analysis based on the generalizable AMUCL framework.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04075"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2307.04114", "Date": "Sun, 09 Jul 2023 08:07:43 ", "Title": "FILM: How can Few-Shot Image Classification Benefit from Pre-Trained Language Models?", "Authors": ["Zihao Jiang", "Yunkai Dang", "Dong Pang", "Huishuai Zhang", "Weiran Huang"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.MM"}, "abstract": "Few-shot learning aims to train models that can be generalized to novel classes with only a few samples.

Most of the existing models are built to learn single system dynamics from observed historical data and predict the future trajectory. In practice, however, we might observe multiple systems that are generated across different environments, which differ in latent exogenous factors such as temperature and gravity. One simple solution is to learn multiple environment-specific models, but it fails to exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and offers poor prediction results where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Here, we present GG-ODE (Generalized Graph Ordinary Differential Equations), a machine learning framework for learning continuous multi-agent system dynamics across environments. Our model learns system dynamics using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) parameterized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the continuous interaction among agents. We achieve the model generalization by assuming the dynamics across different environments are governed by common physics laws that can be captured via learning a shared ODE function. The distinct latent exogenous factors learned for each environment are incorporated into the ODE function to account for their differences. To improve model performance, we additionally design two regularization losses to (1) enforce the orthogonality between the learned initial states and exogenous factors via mutual information minimization; and (2) reduce the temporal variance of learned exogenous factors within the same system via contrastive learning.

A promising candidate for the faithful embedding of data with varying structure is product manifolds of component spaces of different geometries (spherical, hyperbolic, or euclidean). In this paper, we take a closer look at the structure of product manifold embedding spaces and argue that each component space in a product contributes differently to expressing structures in the input graph, hence should be weighted accordingly. This is different from previous works which consider the roles of different components equally. We then propose WEIGHTED-PM, a data-driven method for learning embedding of heterogeneous graphs in weighted product manifolds. Our method utilizes the topological information of the input graph to automatically determine the weight of each component in product spaces.
