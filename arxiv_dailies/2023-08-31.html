It is diagnosed by manual multi-class tumor grading using a tissue whole slide image (WSI), which is subjective and suffers from inter-pathologist variability. We propose an automated weakly-supervised grading approach for cSCC WSIs that is trained using WSI-level grade and does not require fine-grained tumor annotations. The proposed model, RACR-MIL, transforms each WSI into a bag of tiled patches and leverages attention-based multiple-instance learning to assign a WSI-level grade. We propose three key innovations to address general as well as cSCC-specific challenges in tumor grading. First, we leverage spatial and semantic proximity to define a WSI graph that encodes both local and non-local dependencies between tumor regions and leverage graph attention convolution to derive contextual patch features. Second, we introduce a novel ordinal ranking constraint on the patch attention network to ensure that higher-grade tumor regions are assigned higher attention. Third, we use tumor depth as an auxiliary task to improve grade classification in a multitask learning framework. RACR-MIL achieves 2-9% improvement in grade classification over existing weakly-supervised approaches on a dataset of 718 cSCC tissue images and localizes the tumor better. The model achieves 5-20% higher accuracy in difficult-to-classify high-risk grade classes and is robust to class imbalance.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15618"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.15984", "Date": "Wed, 30 Aug 2023 12:13:13 ", "Title": "Learning Structure-from-Motion with Graph Attention Networks", "Authors": ["Lucas Brynte and Jos\\'e Pedro Iglesias and Carl Olsson and Fredrik Kahl"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.LG"}, "abstract": "In this paper we tackle the problem of learning Structure-from-Motion (SfM) through the use of graph attention networks. SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors, referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA), starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA, conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation, pose averaging or triangulation) which provides an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views, and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives, and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods, and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15984"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.16139", "Date": "Wed, 30 Aug 2023 16:52:20 ", "Title": "MedShapeNet -- A Large-Scale Dataset of 3D Medical Shapes for Computer Vision", "Authors": ["Jianning Li", "Antonio Pepe", "Christina Gsaxner", "Gijs Luijten", "Yuan Jin", "Narmada Ambigapathy", "Enrico Nasca", "Naida Solak", "Gian Marco Melito", "Afaque R.

Prior to the deep learning era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design (CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes, and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality - VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing.

For example, previous research has shown that malware can be hidden in deep learning models. Hiding information in a learning model can be viewed as a form of steganography. In this research, we consider the general question of the steganographic capacity of learning models. Specifically, for a wide range of models, we determine the number of low-order bits of the trained parameters that can be overwritten, without adversely affecting model performance. For each model considered, we graph the accuracy as a function of the number of low-order bits that have been overwritten, and for selected models, we also analyze the steganographic capacity of individual layers. The models that we test include the classic machine learning techniques of Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM); the popular general deep learning models of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); the highly-successful Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); the pre-trained transfer learning-based models VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Xception; and, finally, an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN). In all cases, we find that a majority of the bits of each trained parameter can be overwritten before the accuracy degrades. Of the models tested, the steganographic capacity ranges from 7.04 KB for our LR experiments, to 44.74 MB for InceptionV3.

Within the context of best-arm identification (BAI) problems, the goal of the agent lies in finding the optimal arm, i.e., the one with highest expected reward, as accurately and efficiently as possible. Nevertheless, the sequential interaction protocol of classical BAI problems, where the agent has complete control over the arm being pulled at each round, does not effectively model several decision-making problems of interest (e.g., off-policy learning, partially controllable environments, and human feedback). For this reason, in this work, we propose a novel strict generalization of the classical BAI problem that we refer to as best-arm identification under mediators' feedback (BAI-MF). More specifically, we consider the scenario in which the learner has access to a set of mediators, each of which selects the arms on the agent's behalf according to a stochastic and possibly unknown policy. The mediator, then, communicates back to the agent the pulled arm together with the observed reward. In this setting, the agent's goal lies in sequentially choosing which mediator to query to identify with high probability the optimal arm while minimizing the identification time, i.e., the sample complexity. To this end, we first derive and analyze a statistical lower bound on the sample complexity specific to our general mediator feedback scenario. Then, we propose a sequential decision-making strategy for discovering the best arm under the assumption that the mediators' policies are known to the learner. As our theory verifies, this algorithm matches the lower bound both almost surely and in expectation. Finally, we extend these results to cases where the mediators' policies are unknown to the learner obtaining comparable results.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15552"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.15559", "Date": "Tue, 29 Aug 2023 18:29:56 ", "Title": "Glocal Explanations of Expected Goal Models in Soccer", "Authors": ["Mustafa Cavus", "Adrian Stando", "Przemyslaw Biecek"], "Categories": "cs.LG stat.ML", "Comments": ["26 pages", "8 figures"]}, "abstract": "The expected goal models have gained popularity, but their interpretability is often limited, especially when trained using black-box methods. Explainable artificial intelligence tools have emerged to enhance model transparency and extract descriptive knowledge for a single observation or for all observations. However, explaining black-box models for a specific group of observations may be more useful in some domains. This paper introduces the glocal explanations (between local and global levels) of the expected goal models to enable performance analysis at the team and player levels by proposing the use of aggregated versions of the SHAP values and partial dependence profiles. This allows knowledge to be extracted from the expected goal model for a player or team rather than just a single shot. In addition, we conducted real-data applications to illustrate the usefulness of aggregated SHAP and aggregated profiles. The paper concludes with remarks on the potential of these explanations for performance analysis in soccer analytics.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15559"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.15575", "Date": "Tue, 29 Aug 2023 19:04:42 ", "Title": "Prototype Fission: Closing Set for Robust Open-set Semi-supervised Learning", "Authors": ["Xuwei Tan", "Yi-Jie Huang", "Yaqian Li"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.CV"}, "abstract": "Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) has been proven vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in realistic large-scale unsupervised datasets due to over-confident pseudo-labeling OODs as in-distribution (ID). A key underlying problem is class-wise latent space spreading from closed seen space to open unseen space, and the bias is further magnified in SSL's self-training loops. To close the ID distribution set so that OODs are better rejected for safe SSL, we propose Prototype Fission(PF) to divide class-wise latent spaces into compact sub-spaces by automatic fine-grained latent space mining, driven by coarse-grained labels only. Specifically, we form multiple unique learnable sub-class prototypes for each class, optimized towards both diversity and consistency. The Diversity Modeling term encourages samples to be clustered by one of the multiple sub-class prototypes, while the Consistency Modeling term clusters all samples of the same class to a global prototype. Instead of \"opening set\", i.e., modeling OOD distribution, Prototype Fission \"closes set\" and makes it hard for OOD samples to fit in sub-class latent space. Therefore, PF is compatible with existing methods for further performance gains. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in open-set SSL settings in terms of successfully forming sub-classes, discriminating OODs from IDs and improving overall accuracy.

One concern is measurement tampering, where the AI system manipulates multiple measurements to create the illusion of good results instead of achieving the desired outcome. In this work, we build four new text-based datasets to evaluate measurement tampering detection techniques on large language models. Concretely, given sets of text inputs and measurements aimed at determining if some outcome occurred, as well as a base model able to accurately predict measurements, the goal is to determine if examples where all measurements indicate the outcome actually had the outcome occur, or if this was caused by measurement tampering. We demonstrate techniques that outperform simple baselines on most datasets, but don't achieve maximum performance.

However, GNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade their effectiveness. Recent state-of-the-art approaches in adversarial attacks rely on gradient-based meta-learning to selectively perturb a single edge with the highest attack score until they reach the budget constraint. While effective in identifying vulnerable links, these methods are plagued by high computational costs. By leveraging continuous relaxation and parameterization of the graph structure, we propose a novel attack method called Differentiable Graph Attack (DGA) to efficiently generate effective attacks and meanwhile eliminate the need for costly retraining. Compared to the state-of-the-art, DGA achieves nearly equivalent attack performance with 6 times less training time and 11 times smaller GPU memory footprint on different benchmark datasets.

Previous approaches achieving exact recovery do not allow any small clusters of size $o(\\sqrt{n})$, or require a size gap between the smallest recovered cluster and the largest non-recovered cluster. We provide an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) which removes these requirements and provably recovers large clusters regardless of the remaining cluster sizes. Mid-sized clusters pose unique challenges to the analysis, since their proximity to the recovery threshold makes them highly sensitive to small noise perturbations and precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques, including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can drastically change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue perturbation bounds of potential independent interest. Using our gap-free clustering procedure, we obtain efficient algorithms for the problem of clustering with a faulty oracle with superior query complexities, notably achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity even in the presence of a large number of small clusters. Our gap-free clustering procedure also leads to improved algorithms for recursive clustering.

In this paper, we focus on exploring the correlation between distribution learning and clustering, with the motivation to fill the gap between these two fields, utilizing an autoencoder (AE) to encode images into a high-dimensional latent space. Then, Monte-Carlo Marginalization (MCMarg) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss are used to fit the Gaussian components of the GMM and learn the data distribution. Finally, image clustering is achieved through each Gaussian component of GMM. Yet, the \"curse of dimensionality\" poses severe challenges for most clustering algorithms.

These highly deformable materials can have heterogeneous material properties, and can experience heterogeneous deformations with or without underlying material heterogeneity. Many recent works have established that computational modeling approaches are well suited for understanding and predicting the consequences of material heterogeneity and for interpreting observed heterogeneous strain fields. In particular, there has been significant work towards developing inverse analysis approaches that can convert observed kinematic quantities (e.g., displacement, strain) to material properties and mechanical state. Despite the success of these approaches, they are not necessarily generalizable and often rely on tight control and knowledge of boundary conditions. Here, we will build on the recent advances (and ubiquity) of machine learning approaches to explore alternative approaches to detect patterns in heterogeneous material properties and mechanical behavior. Specifically, we will explore unsupervised learning approaches to clustering and ensemble clutering to identify heterogeneous regions.

This temporal element produces a more complex problem that can potentially leave current solutions under-constrained, unstable during training, or prone to varying degrees of mode collapse. In FETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator's sampling space using a seq2seq style adversarial auto encoder (AAE), where adversarial training is used to match the training distribution in both the feature space and the lower dimensional sampling space. This additional constraint provides a loose assurance that the temporal distribution of the synthetic samples will not collapse. In addition, the First Above Threshold (FAT) operator is introduced to supplement the reconstruction of encoded sequences, which improves training stability and the overall quality of the synthetic data being generated.

Instead of jointly minimizing empirical risk with the penalty, we minimize the penalty under the constraint of optimality of the empirical risk. This change guarantees that the domain generalization penalty cannot impair optimization of the empirical risk, i.e., in-distribution performance.

With the emergence of multimodal data, tasks can now be referenced by multiple indices. In this paper, we employ high-order tensors, with each mode corresponding to a task index, to naturally represent tasks referenced by multiple indices and preserve their structural relations. Based on this representation, we propose a general framework of low-rank MTL methods with tensorized support vector machines (SVMs) and least square support vector machines (LSSVMs), where the CP factorization is deployed over the coefficient tensor. Our approach allows to model the task relation through a linear combination of shared factors weighted by task-specific factors and is generalized to both classification and regression problems.

Thus, it is vital for hydrocarbon extraction industries to forecast their production to optimize their operations and avoid losses. Big companies have realized that exploiting the power of deep learning (DL) and the massive amount of data from various oil wells for this purpose can save a lot of operational costs and reduce unwanted environmental impacts. In this direction, researchers have proposed models using conventional machine learning (ML) techniques for oil production forecasting. However, these techniques are inappropriate for this problem as they can not capture historical patterns found in time series data, resulting in inaccurate predictions. This research aims to overcome these issues by developing advanced data-driven regression models using sequential convolutions and long short-term memory (LSTM) units. Exhaustive analyses are conducted to select the optimal sequence length, model hyperparameters, and cross-well dataset formation to build highly generalized robust models. A comprehensive experimental study on Volve oilfield data validates the proposed models. It reveals that the LSTM-based sequence learning model can predict oil production better than the 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) with mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 score of 111.16 and 0.98, respectively. It is also found that the LSTM-based model performs better than all the existing state-of-the-art solutions and achieves a 37% improvement compared to a standard linear regression, which is considered the baseline model in this work.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16105"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.16122", "Date": "Wed, 30 Aug 2023 16:21:02 ", "Title": "Spatial Graph Coarsening: Weather and Weekday Prediction with London's Bike-Sharing Service using GNN", "Authors": ["Yuta Sato", "Pak Hei Lam", "Shruti Gupta", "Fareesah Hussain"], "Categories": "cs.LG"}, "abstract": "This study introduced the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN) for predicting the weather and weekday of a day in London, from the dataset of Santander Cycles bike-sharing system as a graph classification task.

This paper demonstrates how a surrogate-based autotuning approach can be used to address fundamental problems of parameter selection in RandNLA algorithms. In particular, we provide a detailed investigation of surrogate-based autotuning for sketch-and-precondition (SAP) based randomized least squares methods, which have been one of the great success stories in modern RandNLA. Empirical results show that our surrogate-based autotuning approach can achieve near-optimal performance with much less tuning cost than a random search (up to about 4x fewer trials of different parameter configurations).

Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task for researchers and practitioners to design/select optimal GNN rchitectures in diverse graphs. To save human efforts and computational costs, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, there are no existing Graph NAS methods that satisfy explainability, efficiency, and adaptability to various graphs. Therefore, we propose an efficient and explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm that makes the decision process explainable. The search space includes only fundamental functions that can handle homophilic and heterophilic graphs. The search algorithm efficiently searches for the best GNN architecture via Monte-Carlo tree search without neural models. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate our method compared with twelve hand-crafted GNN architectures and three Graph NAS methods in four graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS increases AUC up to 3.6 and reduces run time up to 78\\% compared with the state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods.

However, devices often have non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, meaning their local data distributions can vary significantly. The heterogeneity in input data distributions across devices, commonly referred to as the feature shift problem, can adversely impact the training convergence and accuracy of the global model. To analyze the intrinsic causes of the feature shift problem, we develop a generalization error bound in FL, which motivates us to propose FedCiR, a client-invariant representation learning framework that enables clients to extract informative and client-invariant features. Specifically, we improve the mutual information term between representations and labels to encourage representations to carry essential classification knowledge, and diminish the mutual information term between the client set and representations conditioned on labels to promote representations of clients to be client-invariant. We further incorporate two regularizers into the FL framework to bound the mutual information terms with an approximate global representation distribution to compensate for the absence of the ground-truth global representation distribution, thus achieving informative and client-invariant feature extraction. To achieve global representation distribution approximation, we propose a data-free mechanism performed by the server without compromising privacy.

While dense feedback annotations are expensive to acquire and integrate, sparse feedback presents a structural design choice between ratings (e.g., score Response A on a scale of 1-7) and rankings (e.g., is Response A better than Response B?). In this work, we analyze the effect of this design choice for the alignment and evaluation of LLMs. We uncover an inconsistency problem wherein the preferences inferred from ratings and rankings significantly disagree 60% for both human and AI annotators. Our subsequent analysis identifies various facets of annotator biases that explain this phenomena, such as human annotators would rate denser responses higher while preferring accuracy during pairwise judgments. To our surprise, we also observe that the choice of feedback protocol also has a significant effect on the evaluation of aligned LLMs. In particular, we find that LLMs that leverage rankings data for alignment (say model X) are preferred over those that leverage ratings data (say model Y), with a rank-based evaluation protocol (is X/Y's response better than reference response?) but not with a rating-based evaluation protocol (score Rank X/Y's response on a scale of 1-7). Our findings thus shed light on critical gaps in methods for evaluating the real-world utility of language models and their strong dependence on the feedback protocol used for alignment.

While most existing clustered federated learning methods employ either model gradients or inference outputs as metrics for client partitioning, with the goal of grouping similar devices together, may still have heterogeneity within each cluster. Moreover, there is a scarcity of research exploring the underlying reasons for determining the appropriate timing for clustering, resulting in the common practice of assigning each client to its own individual cluster, particularly in the context of highly non independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage decoupling federated learning algorithm with adaptive personalization layers named FedTSDP, where client clustering is performed twice according to inference outputs and model weights, respectively. Hopkins amended sampling is adopted to determine the appropriate timing for clustering and the sampling weight of public unlabeled data.

Based on the learned multi-scale graph, we utilize a newly designed graph convolution module to exploit multi-scale epidemic patterns. This module allows us to facilitate multi-scale epidemic modeling by mining both scale-shared and scale-specific pat-terns.

It is challenging to account for correlated variables without increasing the complexity of the interpretability technique. We overcame this by clustering features into groups and comparing the most important groups for each model.

To address these concerns, wireless charging, particularly, Mobile Energy Disseminators (MEDs) have emerged as a promising solution. The MED is mounted behind a large vehicle and charges all participating EVs within a radius upstream of it. Unfortuantely, during such V2V charging, the MED and EVs inadvertently form platoons, thereby occupying multiple lanes and impairing overall corridor travel efficiency. In addition, constrained budgets for MED deployment necessitate the development of an effective dispatching strategy to determine optimal timing and locations for introducing the MEDs into traffic. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methodology to develop a vehicle dispatching framework. In the first component of the framework, we develop a realistic reinforcement learning environment termed \"ChargingEnv\" which incorporates a reliable charging simulation system that accounts for common practical issues in wireless charging deployment, specifically, the charging panel misalignment. The second component, the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, is trained to control MED dispatching through continuous interactions with ChargingEnv. Numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MED deployment decision processor. The experiment results suggest that the proposed model can significantly enhance EV travel range while efficiently deploying a optimal number of MEDs. The proposed model is found to be not only practical in its applicability but also has promises of real-world effectiveness.
