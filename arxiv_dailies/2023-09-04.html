Obtaining such desirable qualities is challenging when relying on a single camera. The proposed dataset addresses this limitation by leveraging three modalities: RGB, push-broom visible hyperspectral camera, and snapshot infrared hyperspectral camera, each offering distinct spatial and spectral resolutions. Different camera systems exhibit varying photometric properties, resulting in a trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution. RGB cameras typically offer high spatial resolution but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral cameras possess high spectral resolution at the expense of spatial resolution. Moreover, hyperspectral cameras themselves employ different capturing techniques and spectral ranges, further complicating the acquisition of comprehensive data. By integrating the photometric properties of these modalities, a single synthetic hyperspectral image can be generated, facilitating the exploration of broader spectral-spatial relationships for improved analysis, monitoring, and decision-making across various fields. This paper emphasizes the importance of multi-modal fusion in producing a high-quality synthetic hyperspectral dataset with consistent spectral intervals between bands.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00005"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2309.00007", "Date": "Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:18:47 ", "Title": "When Measures are Unreliable: Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations toward Top-$k$ Multi-Label Learning", "Authors": ["Yuchen Sun", "Qianqian Xu", "Zitai Wang", "and Qingming Huang"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG", "Comments": ["22 pages", "7 figures", "accepted by ACM MM 2023"]}, "abstract": "With the great success of deep neural networks, adversarial learning has received widespread attention in various studies, ranging from multi-class learning to multi-label learning. However, existing adversarial attacks toward multi-label learning only pursue the traditional visual imperceptibility but ignore the new perceptible problem coming from measures such as Precision@$k$ and mAP@$k$. Specifically, when a well-trained multi-label classifier performs far below the expectation on some samples, the victim can easily realize that this performance degeneration stems from attack, rather than the model itself. Therefore, an ideal multi-labeling adversarial attack should manage to not only deceive visual perception but also evade monitoring of measures. To this end, this paper first proposes the concept of measure imperceptibility. Then, a novel loss function is devised to generate such adversarial perturbations that could achieve both visual and measure imperceptibility. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm, which enjoys a convex objective, is established to optimize this objective. Finally, extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets, such as PASCAL VOC 2012, MS COCO, and NUS WIDE, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in attacking the top-$k$ multi-label systems.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00007"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2309.00008", "Date": "Fri, 04 Aug 2023 06:03:28 ", "Title": "Large-Scale Public Data Improves Differentially Private Image Generation Quality", "Authors": ["Ruihan Wu", "Chuan Guo", "Kamalika Chaudhuri"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG"}, "abstract": "Public data has been frequently used to improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off of differentially private machine learning, but prior work largely assumes that this data come from the same distribution as the private.

However, existing CL methods require a large amount of raw data, which is often unavailable due to copyright considerations and privacy risks. Instead, stakeholders usually release pre-trained machine learning models as a service (MLaaS), which users can access via APIs. This paper considers two practical-yet-novel CL settings: data-efficient CL (DECL-APIs) and data-free CL (DFCL-APIs), which achieve CL from a stream of APIs with partial or no raw data. Performing CL under these two new settings faces several challenges: unavailable full raw data, unknown model parameters, heterogeneous models of arbitrary architecture and scale, and catastrophic forgetting of previous APIs. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel data-free cooperative continual distillation learning framework that distills knowledge from a stream of APIs into a CL model by generating pseudo data, just by querying APIs. Specifically, our framework includes two cooperative generators and one CL model, forming their training as an adversarial game. We first use the CL model and the current API as fixed discriminators to train generators via a derivative-free method. Generators adversarially generate hard and diverse synthetic data to maximize the response gap between the CL model and the API. Next, we train the CL model by minimizing the gap between the responses of the CL model and the black-box API on synthetic data, to transfer the API's knowledge to the CL model. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization term based on network similarity to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previous APIs.Our method performs comparably to classic CL with full raw data on the MNIST and SVHN in the DFCL-APIs setting.

Intuitively, a high-quality anchor graph plays an essential role in the success of AMVGC. However, the existing AMVGC methods only consider single-structure information, i.e., local or global structure, which provides insufficient information for the learning task. To be specific, the over-scattered global structure leads to learned anchors failing to depict the cluster partition well. In contrast, the local structure with an improper similarity measure results in potentially inaccurate anchor assignment, ultimately leading to sub-optimal clustering performance. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel anchor-based multi-view graph clustering framework termed Efficient Multi-View Graph Clustering with Local and Global Structure Preservation (EMVGC-LG). Specifically, a unified framework with a theoretical guarantee is designed to capture local and global information. Besides, EMVGC-LG jointly optimizes anchor construction and graph learning to enhance the clustering quality. In addition, EMVGC-LG inherits the linear complexity of existing AMVGC methods respecting the sample number, which is time-economical and scales well with the data size.

Fraud detection is overwhelmingly associated with the greater field of anomaly detection, which is usually performed via unsupervised learning techniques because of the lack of labeled data needed for supervised learning. However, a small quantity of labeled data does often exist. This research article aims to evaluate the efficacy of a deep semi-supervised anomaly detection technique, called Deep SAD, for detecting fraud in high-frequency financial data. We use exclusive proprietary limit order book data from the TMX exchange in Montr\\'eal, with a small set of true labeled instances of fraud, to evaluate Deep SAD against its unsupervised predecessor.

To achieve this, we build a generative trigger function that can learn to manipulate the benign samples with an imperceptible flexible trigger pattern and simultaneously make the trigger pattern include the most significant hidden features of the attacker-chosen label. Moreover, our trigger generator can keep learning and adapt across different rounds, allowing it to adjust to changes in the global model. By filling the distinguishable difference (the mapping between the trigger pattern and target label), we make our attack naturally stealthy.

Given data of past $n$-dimensional LPs, we learn an $n\\times k$ \\textit{projection matrix} ($n > k$), which reduces the dimensionality from $n$ to $k$. Then, we address future LP instances by solving $k$-dimensional LPs and recovering $n$-dimensional solutions by multiplying the projection matrix. This idea is compatible with any user-preferred LP solvers, hence a versatile approach to faster LP solving. One natural question is: how much data is sufficient to ensure the recovered solutions' quality? We address this question based on the idea of \\textit{data-driven algorithm design}, which relates the amount of data sufficient for generalization guarantees to the \\textit{pseudo-dimension} of performance metrics.

However, low-fidelity models, while often displaying important qualitative spatio-temporal features, fail to accurately capture the onset of instability and critical transients observed in the high-fidelity models, making them impractical as surrogate models. To address this shortcoming, we present a new data-driven strategy that combines dimensionality reduction with multi-fidelity neural network surrogates. The key idea is to generate a spatial basis by applying the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to high-fidelity solution snapshots, and approximate the dynamics of the reduced states - time-parameter-dependent expansion coefficients of the POD basis - using a multi-fidelity long-short term memory (LSTM) network. By mapping low-fidelity reduced states to their high-fidelity counterpart, the proposed reduced-order surrogate model enables the efficient recovery of full solution fields over time and parameter variations in a non-intrusive manner.

However, fine-tuning LLMs in federated learning settings still lacks adequate support from existing FL frameworks because it has to deal with optimizing the consumption of significant communication and computational resources, data preparation for different tasks, and distinct information protection demands. This paper first discusses these challenges of federated fine-tuning LLMs, and introduces our package FS-LLM as a main contribution, which consists of the following components: (1) we build an end-to-end benchmarking pipeline, automizing the processes of dataset preprocessing, federated fine-tuning execution, and performance evaluation on federated LLM fine-tuning; (2) we provide comprehensive federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithm implementations and versatile programming interfaces for future extension in FL scenarios with low communication and computation costs, even without accessing the full model; (3) we adopt several accelerating and resource-efficient operators for fine-tuning LLMs with limited resources and the flexible pluggable sub-routines for interdisciplinary study. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of FS-LLM and benchmark advanced LLMs with state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithms in FL settings, which also yields valuable insights into federated fine-tuning LLMs for the research community.

FL was proposed as a stepping-stone towards privacy-preserving machine learning, but it has been shown vulnerable to issues such as leakage of private information, lack of personalization of the model, and the possibility of having a trained model that is fairer to some groups than to others. In this paper, we address the triadic interaction among personalization, privacy guarantees, and fairness attained by models trained within the FL framework.

However, clients in FL often hold very diverse datasets representing heterogeneous communities, making it important to protect their sensitive information while still ensuring that the trained model upholds the aspect of fairness for the users. To attain this objective, a method is put forth that introduces group privacy assurances through the utilization of $d$-privacy (aka metric privacy). $d$-privacy represents a localized form of differential privacy that relies on a metric-oriented obfuscation approach to maintain the original data's topological distribution. This method, besides enabling personalized model training in a federated approach and providing formal privacy guarantees, possesses significantly better group fairness measured under a variety of standard metrics than a global model trained within a classical FL template.

By means of numerical analysis, it is shown that, depending on the network parameters, the characteristic probabilities for continuous and discrete operations can exhibit either close or drastically different behavior.

We present a new benchmark named FACET (FAirness in Computer Vision EvaluaTion), a large, publicly available evaluation set of 32k images for some of the most common vision tasks - image classification, object detection and segmentation. For every image in FACET, we hired expert reviewers to manually annotate person-related attributes such as perceived skin tone and hair type, manually draw bounding boxes and label fine-grained person-related classes such as disk jockey or guitarist. In addition, we use FACET to benchmark state-of-the-art vision models and present a deeper understanding of potential performance disparities and challenges across sensitive demographic attributes. With the exhaustive annotations collected, we probe models using single demographics attributes as well as multiple attributes using an intersectional approach (e.g. hair color and perceived skin tone). Our results show that classification, detection, segmentation, and visual grounding models exhibit performance disparities across demographic attributes and intersections of attributes. These harms suggest that not all people represented in datasets receive fair and equitable treatment in these vision tasks.

Recent works explore vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when meet with ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel decomposition-aggregation framework, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to enrich semantic contexts. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labelling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation is further designed to achieve multi-level alignment and deep fusion between vision and text.

We use regression based weak learners to create the proposed ensemble technique. The proposed combined regression strategy uses proximity measure as area between two survival curves. The proposed model shows a construction which ensures that it performs better than the Random Survival Forest. The paper discusses a novel technique to select the most important variable in the combined regression setup. We perform a simulation study to show that our proposition for finding relevance of the variables works quite well. We also use three real-life datasets to illustrate the model.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00417"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2309.00462", "Date": "Fri, 01 Sep 2023 13:53:33 ", "Title": "New metrics for analyzing continual learners", "Authors": ["Nicolas Michel", "Giovanni Chierchia", "Romain Negrel", "Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Bercher", "Toshihiko Yamasaki"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI", "Comments": ["6 pages", "presented at MIRU 2023"]}, "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance when trained on independent and identically distributed data from a fixed set of classes. However, in real-world scenarios, it can be desirable to train models on a continuous stream of data where multiple classification tasks are presented sequentially. This scenario, known as Continual Learning (CL) poses challenges to standard learning algorithms which struggle to maintain knowledge of old tasks while learning new ones. This stability-plasticity dilemma remains central to CL and multiple metrics have been proposed to adequately measure stability and plasticity separately. However, none considers the increasing difficulty of the classification task, which inherently results in performance loss for any model. In that sense, we analyze some limitations of current metrics and identify the presence of setup-induced forgetting. Therefore, we propose new metrics that account for the task's increasing difficulty. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics can provide new insights into the stability-plasticity trade-off achieved by models in the continual learning environment.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00462"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2309.00543", "Date": "Fri, 01 Sep 2023 15:52:32 ", "Title": "Curating Naturally Adversarial Datasets for Trustworthy AI in Healthcare", "Authors": ["Sydney Pugh", "Ivan Ruchkin", "Insup Lee", "James Weimer"], "Categories": "cs.LG cs.AI"}, "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown promising predictive accuracy for time-series healthcare applications. However, ensuring the robustness of these models is vital for building trustworthy AI systems. Existing research predominantly focuses on robustness to synthetic adversarial examples, crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to clean input data. However, these synthetic adversarial examples do not accurately reflect the most challenging real-world scenarios, especially in the context of healthcare data. Consequently, robustness to synthetic adversarial examples may not necessarily translate to robustness against naturally occurring adversarial examples, which is highly desirable for trustworthy AI. We propose a method to curate datasets comprised of natural adversarial examples to evaluate model robustness. The method relies on probabilistic labels obtained from automated weakly-supervised labeling that combines noisy and cheap-to-obtain labeling heuristics. Based on these labels, our method adversarially orders the input data and uses this ordering to construct a sequence of increasingly adversarial datasets. Our evaluation on six medical case studies and three non-medical case studies demonstrates the efficacy and statistical validity of our approach to generating naturally adversarial datasets", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00543"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2309.00296", "Date": "Fri, 01 Sep 2023 07:03:05 ", "Title": "End-to-end Lidar-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Racing", "Authors": ["Meraj Mammadov"], "Categories": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "Comments": ["6 pages"]}, "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach in the domains of automation and robotics, offering powerful solutions to complex problems that conventional methods struggle to address. In scenarios where the problem definitions are elusive and challenging to quantify, learning-based solutions such as RL become particularly valuable. One instance of such complexity can be found in the realm of car racing, a dynamic and unpredictable environment that demands sophisticated decision-making algorithms. This study focuses on developing and training an RL agent to navigate a racing environment solely using feedforward raw lidar and velocity data in a simulated context. The agent's performance, trained in the simulation environment, is then experimentally evaluated in a real-world racing scenario. This exploration underlines the feasibility and potential benefits of RL algorithm enhancing autonomous racing performance, especially in the environments where prior map information is not available.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00296"}];
