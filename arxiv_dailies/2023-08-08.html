In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques by leveraging the synergy between label-to-image generators and image-to-label segmentation models. Specifically, we design and train Robusta, a novel robust conditional generative adversarial network to generate realistic and plausible perturbed or outlier images that can be used to train reliable segmentation models. We conduct in-depth studies of the proposed generative model, assess the performance and robustness of the downstream segmentation network, and demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques in the face of real-world perturbations, distribution shifts, and out-of-distribution samples. Our results suggest that this approach could be valuable in safety-critical applications, where the reliability of semantic segmentation techniques is of utmost importance and comes with a limited computational budget in inference.

Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by predicting pseudo-labels for each pixel from a class-wise probability distribution output by a model. If the predicted probability distribution is incorrect, however, this leads to poor segmentation results, which can have knock-on consequences in safety critical systems, like medical images or self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand what a model does not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification. Recently, neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image classification, and they have been a computationally efficient and effective method for uncertainty quantification.

With the improved numerical support in recent hardware, including multiple variants of integer and floating point, mixed-precision quantization has become necessary to achieve high-quality results with low model cost. Prior mixed-precision quantization methods have performed a post-training quantization search, which compromises on accuracy, or a differentiable quantization search, which leads to high memory usage from branching. Therefore, we propose the first one-shot mixed-precision quantization search that eliminates the need for retraining in both integer and low-precision floating point models. We evaluate our floating-point and integer quantization search (FLIQS) on multiple convolutional networks and vision transformer models to discover Pareto-optimal models. Our approach discovers models that improve upon uniform precision, manual mixed-precision, and recent integer quantization search methods. With the proposed integer quantization search, we increase the accuracy of ResNet-18 on ImageNet by 1.31% points and ResNet-50 by 0.90% points with equivalent model cost over previous methods. Additionally, for the first time, we explore a novel mixed-precision floating-point search and improve MobileNetV2 by up to 0.98% points compared to prior state-of-the-art FP8 models.

Efficiency, accuracy, and timely detection of FHB in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley breeding programs. In recent years, various image processing techniques have been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early detection of FHB. The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods, such as U-Net, employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic relations. However, these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling dependencies inside the input data, and their ability to model multi-scale objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited. Vision transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction, due to insufficient low-level details, may also limit localization capabilities. To overcome these limitations, a new Context Bridge is proposed to integrate the local representation capability of the U-Net network in the transformer model. In addition, the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is replaced with Efficient Self-attention, which is less complicated than other state-of-the-art methods. To train the proposed network, 12,000 wheat images from an FHB-inoculated wheat field at the SDSU research farm in Volga, SD, were captured. In addition to healthy and unhealthy plants, these images encompass various stages of the disease. A team of expert pathologists annotated the images for training and evaluating the developed model.

Previous work on this question only considered the scaling of data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model size, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision transformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K hours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos) with image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked autoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible to run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that it is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human scales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up simultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter ViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a spatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach human-level accuracy on ImageNet.

Many theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of non-stationarity by coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies. Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multi-timescale methods, but such synchrony is infeasible in many decentralized applications. In this paper, we study an asynchronous variant of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient conditions under which the asynchronous algorithm drives play to equilibrium with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchrony assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to asynchronous generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multi-timescale methods that study Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics.

In recent research, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been widely utilized for MI-EEG classification. The challenges of training neural networks for MI-EEG signals classification include low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarity, non-linearity, and high complexity of EEG signals. The features computed by CNN-based networks on the highly noisy MI-EEG signals contain irrelevant information. Subsequently, the feature maps of the CNN-based network computed from the noisy and irrelevant features contain irrelevant information. Thus, many non-contributing features often mislead the neural network training and degrade the classification performance. Hence, a novel feature reweighting approach is proposed to address this issue. The proposed method gives a noise reduction mechanism named feature reweighting module that suppresses irrelevant temporal and channel feature maps. The feature reweighting module of the proposed method generates scores that reweight the feature maps to reduce the impact of irrelevant information.

Adversarial Training (AT) is a well-established technique to enhance adversarial robustness, but it often comes at the cost of decreased generalization ability. This paper proposes Robustness Critical Fine-Tuning (RiFT), a novel approach to enhance generalization without compromising adversarial robustness. The core idea of RiFT is to exploit the redundant capacity for robustness by fine-tuning the adversarially trained model on its non-robust-critical module. To do so, we introduce module robust criticality (MRC), a measure that evaluates the significance of a given module to model robustness under worst-case weight perturbations. Using this measure, we identify the module with the lowest MRC value as the non-robust-critical module and fine-tune its weights to obtain fine-tuned weights. Subsequently, we linearly interpolate between the adversarially trained weights and fine-tuned weights to derive the optimal fine-tuned model weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of RiFT on ResNet18, ResNet34, and WideResNet34-10 models trained on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. Our experiments show that \\method can significantly improve both generalization and out-of-distribution robustness by around 1.5% while maintaining or even slightly enhancing adversarial robustness.

Learning in such a fixed reward paradigm in RL can neglect important policy optimization considerations, such as state space coverage and safety. Moreover, it can fail to encompass broader impacts in terms of social welfare, sustainability, or market stability, potentially leading to undesirable emergent behavior and potentially misaligned policy. To mathematically encapsulate the problem of aligning RL policy optimization with such externalities, we consider a bilevel optimization problem and connect it to a principal-agent framework, where the principal specifies the broader goals and constraints of the system at the upper level and the agent solves a Markov Decision Process (MDP) at the lower level. The upper-level deals with learning a suitable reward parametrization corresponding to the broader goals and the lower-level deals with learning the policy for the agent. We propose Principal driven Policy Alignment via Bilevel RL (PPA-BRL), which efficiently aligns the policy of the agent with the principal's goals. We explicitly analyzed the dependence of the principal's trajectory on the lower-level policy, prove the convergence of PPA-BRL to the stationary point of the problem.

A BLNO is defined by a simple and compact feedforward partially-connected neural network that structurally disentangles inputs with different intrinsic roles, such as the time variable from model parameters of a differential equation, while transferring them into a generic field of interest. BLNOs leverage interpretable latent outputs to enhance the learned dynamics and break the curse of dimensionality by showing excellent generalization properties with small training datasets and short training times on a single processor. Indeed, their generalization error remains comparable regardless of the adopted discretization during the testing phase. Moreover, the partial connections, in place of a fully-connected structure, significantly reduce the number of tunable parameters. We show the capabilities of BLNOs in a challenging test case involving biophysically detailed electrophysiology simulations in a biventricular cardiac model of a pediatric patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The model includes a purkinje network for fast conduction and a heart-torso geometry. Specifically, we trained BLNOs on 150 in silico generated 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) while spanning 7 model parameters, covering cell-scale, organ-level and electrical dyssynchrony.

Specifically, in the considered scenario, the cybertwin serves as a communication agent for each vehicle to exchange information and make offloading decisions in the virtual space. To reduce the latency of task offloading, a KMARL approach is proposed to select the optimal offloading option for each vehicle, where graph neural networks are employed by leveraging domain knowledge concerning graph-structure communication topology and permutation invariance into neural networks.

Stress prediction using biosignal data recorded by wearables is a key area of study in mobile sensing research because real-time stress prediction can enable digital interventions to immediately react at the onset of stress, helping to avoid many psychological and physiological symptoms such as heart rhythm irregularities. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is often used to measure stress. However, major challenges with the prediction of stress using machine learning include the subjectivity and sparseness of the labels, a large feature space, relatively few labels, and a complex nonlinear and subjective relationship between the features and outcomes. To tackle these issues, we examine the use of model personalization: training a separate stress prediction model for each user. To allow the neural network to learn the temporal dynamics of each individual's baseline biosignal patterns, thus enabling personalization with very few labels, we pre-train a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) using self-supervised learning (SSL). We evaluate our method using the Wearable Stress and Affect prediction (WESAD) dataset. We fine-tune the pre-trained networks to the stress prediction task and compare against equivalent models without any self-supervised pre-training. We discover that embeddings learned using our pre-training method outperform supervised baselines with significantly fewer labeled data points: the models trained with SSL require less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance without personalized SSL.

By taking the model's prediction as the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, self-training bootstraps the model with pseudo instances in the target domain. However, the prediction errors of pseudo labels (label noise) challenge the performance of self-training. To address this problem, previous approaches only use reliable pseudo instances, i.e., pseudo instances with high prediction confidence, to retrain the model. Although these strategies effectively reduce the label noise, they are prone to miss the hard examples. In this paper, we propose a new self-training framework for domain adaptation, namely Domain adversarial learning enhanced Self-Training Framework (DaMSTF). Firstly, DaMSTF involves meta-learning to estimate the importance of each pseudo instance, so as to simultaneously reduce the label noise and preserve hard examples. Secondly, we design a meta constructor for constructing the meta-validation set, which guarantees the effectiveness of the meta-learning module by improving the quality of the meta-validation set. Thirdly, we find that the meta-learning module suffers from the training guidance vanishment and tends to converge to an inferior optimal. To this end, we employ domain adversarial learning as a heuristic neural network initialization method, which can help the meta-learning module converge to a better optimal. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DaMSTF.

However, it is also facing a reproducibility crisis, especially in medicine. ML models that are carefully constructed from and evaluated on a training set might not generalize well on data from different patient populations or acquisition instrument settings and protocols. We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g., subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc. using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.

However, existing distributed methods require frequent and substantial cross-GPU communication, leading to significant time overhead and progressively diminishing scalability. Here, we introduce CoFree-GNN, a novel distributed GNN training framework that significantly speeds up the training process by implementing communication-free training. The framework utilizes a Vertex Cut partitioning, i.e., rather than partitioning the graph by cutting the edges between partitions, the Vertex Cut partitions the edges and duplicates the node information to preserve the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework maintains high model accuracy by incorporating a reweighting mechanism to handle a distorted graph distribution that arises from the duplicated nodes. We also propose a modified DropEdge technique to further speed up the training process.

Many HPO techniques rely on naive search methods or assume that the loss function is smooth and continuous, which may not always be the case. Traditional methods, like grid search and Bayesian optimization, often struggle to quickly adapt and efficiently search the loss landscape. Grid search is computationally expensive, while Bayesian optimization can be slow to prime.

This paper presents a data-driven approach for understanding and predicting the pedestrian decision point choice during normal and emergency wayfinding in a multi-story building. For this, we first built an indoor network representation and proposed a data mapping technique to map VR coordinates to the indoor representation. We then used a well-established machine learning algorithm, namely the random forest (RF) model to predict pedestrian decision point choice along a route during four wayfinding tasks in a multi-story building. Pedestrian behavioral data in a multi-story building was collected by a Virtual Reality experiment. The results show a much higher prediction accuracy of decision points using the RF model (i.e., 93% on average) compared to the logistic regression model.

To bridge this research gap, a data-driven framework is proposed that can accurately estimate the missing ramp flows by solely using data collected from loop detectors on freeway mainlines. The proposed framework employs a transfer learning model. The transfer learning model relaxes the assumption that the underlying data distributions of the source and target domains must be the same. Therefore, the proposed framework can guarantee high-accuracy estimation of on-ramp and off-ramp flows on freeways with different traffic patterns, distributions, and characteristics. Based on the experimental results, the flow estimation mean absolute errors range between 23.90 veh/h to 40.85 veh/h for on-ramps, and 31.58 veh/h to 45.31 veh/h for off-ramps; the flow estimation root mean square errors range between 34.55 veh/h to 57.77 veh/h for on-ramps, and 41.75 veh/h to 58.80 veh/h for off-ramps.

The evaluation of a ramp metering strategy is primarily centered around examining its impact on freeway traffic mobility.

Predicting freeway traffic states for the after scenarios following the implementation of a new ramp metering control strategy could offer valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of the target strategy. However, the use of machine learning methods in predicting the freeway traffic state for the after scenarios and evaluating the effectiveness of transportation policies or traffic control strategies such as ramp metering is somewhat limited in the current literature.

In natural settings such as a customer care conversation, the audio is often noisy with speakers regularly switching between different languages as they see fit. We have worked in collaboration with a leading unicorn in the Conversational AI sector to develop Natural Speech Emotion Dataset (NSED). NSED is a natural code-mixed speech emotion dataset where each utterance in a conversation is annotated with emotion, sentiment, valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) values. In this paper, we show that by incorporating word-level VAD value we improve on the task of SER by 2%, for negative emotions, over the baseline value for NSED.

All these contribute to inaccurate uncertainty quantification, which lowers trust in predictions. Hence obtaining accurate model uncertainty quantification and its further improvement are challenging.

The common evaluation method of FD performance is the Risk-coverage (RC) curve, which reveals the trade-off between the data coverage rate and the performance on accepted data. One common way to quantify the RC curve by calculating the area under the RC curve. However, this metric does not inform on how suited any method is for FD, or what the optimal coverage rate should be. As FD aims to achieve higher performance with fewer data discarded, evaluating with partial coverage excluding the most uncertain samples is more intuitive and meaningful than full coverage. In addition, there is an optimal point in the coverage where the model could achieve ideal performance theoretically. We propose the Excess Area Under the Optimal RC Curve (E-AUoptRC), with the area in coverage from the optimal point to the full coverage. Further, the model performance at this optimal point can represent both model learning ability and calibration.

In the text encoder, we propose merging individual symbolic characters to form one semantic unit along with geometric information from the corresponding diagram. For the diagram encoder, we pre-train it under a multi-label classification framework with the symbolic characters as labels. In addition, we enhance the geometry diagram understanding ability via a self-supervised learning method under the masked image modeling auxiliary task. By integrating the proposed model into a general encoder-decoder pipeline for solving geometry problems, we demonstrate its superiority on two benchmark datasets, including GeoQA and Geometry3K, with extensive experiments. Specifically, on GeoQA, the question-solving accuracy is increased from 60.0\\% to 64.1\\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy; on Geometry3K, we reduce the question average solving steps from 6.9 down to 6.0 with marginally higher solving accuracy.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02823"}, {"metadata": {"arXiv": "2308.02869", "Date": "Sat, 05 Aug 2023 12:46:48 ", "Title": "Semi-supervised Learning for Segmentation of Bleeding Regions in Video Capsule Endoscopy", "Authors": ["Hechen Li", "Yanan Wu", "Long Bai", "An Wang", "Tong Chen", "Hongliang Ren"], "Categories": "cs.CV cs.AI", "Comments": ["ICBIR 2023"]}, "abstract": "In the realm of modern diagnostic technology, video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a standout for its high efficacy and non-invasive nature in diagnosing various gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, including obscure bleeding.

While deep learning-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for the automated analysis of VCE images, they often demand large training datasets with comprehensive annotations. Acquiring these labeled datasets tends to be time-consuming, costly, and requires significant domain expertise. To mitigate this issue, we have embraced a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach for the bleeding regions segmentation within VCE.

To circumvent the requirement for source data, source-free domain adaptation has emerged as a viable solution that leverages self-training methods to pseudo-label high-confidence regions and adapt the model to the target data. However, the confidence scores obtained are often highly biased due to over-confidence and class-imbalance issues, which render both model selection and optimization problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration-guided source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation (Cal-SFDA) framework. The core idea is to estimate the expected calibration error (ECE) from the segmentation predictions, serving as a strong indicator of the model's generalization capability to the unlabeled target domain. The estimated ECE scores, in turn, assist the model training and fair selection in both source training and target adaptation stages. During model pre-training on the source domain, we ensure the differentiability of the ECE objective by leveraging the LogSumExp trick and using ECE scores to select the best source checkpoints for adaptation. To enable ECE estimation on the target domain without requiring labels, we train a value net for ECE estimation and apply statistic warm-up on its BatchNorm layers for stability. The estimated ECE scores assist in determining the reliability of prediction and enable class-balanced pseudo-labeling by positively guiding the adaptation progress and inhibiting potential error accumulation.

Given a graphic design containing a photo that needs to be recolored, our model can predict the source colors and the target regions, and then recolor the target regions with the source colors based on the given language-based instruction. The multi-granularity of the instruction allows diverse user intentions. The proposed novel task faces several unique challenges, including: 1) color accuracy for recoloring with exactly the same color from the target design element as specified by the user; 2) multi-granularity instructions for parsing instructions correctly to generate a specific result or multiple plausible ones; and 3) locality for recoloring in semantically meaningful local regions to preserve original image semantics.

However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence.
